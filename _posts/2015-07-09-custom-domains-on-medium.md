This is something I never knew existed. The [Medium](http://medium.com) team posted [this article](https://medium.com/the-story/custom-domains-for-publications-8cb161d9651) back in March about their limited beta launch of custom domains for publications that use Medium as a publishing platform.

The article isn’t super detailed about the whole process and there’s only a few publications on board as of the March 12, 2015 story, but this is something I’ve been wanting to see from Medium for a long time. Their publishing platform is awesome. It’s super easy to use and is formatted very well for long-form articles and stories that feature big and beautiful imagery.

My only hope is that they extend this to everyone at some point in time.

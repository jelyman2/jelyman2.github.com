I finished the Ten Days to a Better Blog (a.k.a. #10DaysBetterBlog) challenge a couple weeks ago and ever since, I just can’t stop writing! I knew I had it in me, but it took signing up for something and actually committing to it in order for me to realize I could actually find the time to put words down and express what’s in my head.

So as a kind recap from the posts from a couple weeks ago, here’s the ten days, broken down by day. If you’d rather see them all listed out as posts, you can do so&nbsp; [here](/c/10daysbetterblog)…

Day 1:&nbsp; [Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?  
](http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=73&action=edit "Edit “Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?”")

My wife told me something quite hilarious this afternoon. She said she saw a woman wear Ugg boots to an interview.

Day 2:&nbsp; [Why I Write  
](http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=141&action=edit "Edit “Why I Write”")

Part of this newfound journey I’m on to blog better is to look inward at myself and try to figure out why I write.

Day 3:&nbsp; [The Space in Which I Craft  
](http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=143&action=edit "Edit “The Space in Which I Craft”")

One thing I’ve come to learn is that having a good writing space is important.

Day 4:&nbsp; [Reflection  
](http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=150&action=edit "Edit “Reflection”")

Every once in a while it’s a good idea to just take some time and reflect.

Day 5: [Half-Way There](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/163/half "Half-Way There")

Today marks my half-way point on my&nbsp; [#10DaysBetterBlog](http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog)&nbsp;journey.

Day 6: [New About Page](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/180/about "New About Page")

I was able to stick to my routine this morning and sat down to craft my About page.

Day 7: [Analytics](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/191/analytics "Analytics")

See, I’m doing the&nbsp; [#10DaysBetterBlog](http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog)&nbsp;challenge as a starting point to build up my blog…

Day 8:&nbsp; [Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart "Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year")

If you’re still with me, I’m on day eight of the&nbsp; [#10DaysBetterBlog](http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog)challenge/workshop/event put on by&nbsp; [John Saddingto](http://john.do/)n of&nbsp; [Desk.pm](http://desk.pm/ "Desk.pm")&nbsp;fame.

Day 9:&nbsp; [Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/209/coffee "Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)")

This morning I ran out of coffee creamer so I hope this all makes sense, if not… meh.

Day 10:&nbsp; [And Then There Was One – Wrapping Up and Looking Back](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/215/one "And Then There Was One – Wrapping Up and Looking Back")

So this is it.

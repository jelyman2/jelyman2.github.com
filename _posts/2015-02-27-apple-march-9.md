If you haven’t heard already, you probably live in a cave. [March 9th](http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/2/26/apple-sending-out-invites-to-a-march-9th-press-event) is Apple’s next event where they’ll probably announce the Apple Watch. Some say there’ll be more than that. With Apple, they could host a brunch, toss out an invite, and people would speculate on it.

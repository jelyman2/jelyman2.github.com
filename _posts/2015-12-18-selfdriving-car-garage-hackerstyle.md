From [Ashlee Vance, Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car/):

> I ask Hotz what it felt like the first time he got the car to work. “Dude,” he says, “the first time it worked was this morning.”

They won't come out and say it but [Tesla's response](https://www.teslamotors.com/support/correction-article-first-person-hack-iphone-built-self-driving-car) seems pretty defensive:

> We think it is extremely unlikely that a single person or even a small company that lacks extensive engineering validation capability will be able to produce an autonomous driving system that can be deployed to production vehicles.

Translation:

> If you don't have an CEO that thinks Mars is something to be conquered in a weekend and billions of dollars, you're going to fail.

Sounds about right.

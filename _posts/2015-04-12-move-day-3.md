The Siskiyous mountains are rough for a moving truck. At times we hummed along at 55 to 60 mph and when we hit big climbs, we sputtered at 35 to 40. It’s rough going for a gas-powered truck-trailer. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, please let me fill you in.

Gas-powered trucks have zero oomph when pulling a load. None. Their torque is present at a much higher rev range than diesel and unfortunately, those higher revs also sit close to the engine’s limit. I wanted to give the truck 100% throttle to power up the hills, but if I did, I felt it would explode. See, to make our journey up a 7% grade even at 40 mph, the engine needed to run at 4000-4250 RPM. For scale, the gauge stops at 6000 and the truck shifts well before then. I was at my limit.

Even with such slow and gas-guzzling climbs, we managed to stay on target for fuel usage and didn’t lose too much time. The most embarrassing part: loaded semi trucks passing you. Damn you, Budget Truck.

After we got out of the mountains, we made a quick pit stop in Redding, CA to top off and sprinted to Sacramento, where we met friends for our last night on the road.

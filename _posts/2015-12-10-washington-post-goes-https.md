This is super cool. More news sites should get on board with this idea.

> In June of this year, the Post announced that we were switching our site to be HTTPS by default, starting with the homepage, the National Security section and the technology blog, The Switch. Since then, weâ€™ve moved over all remaining sections and parts of our site. Today, more than 99% of our traffic is redirected to HTTPS.

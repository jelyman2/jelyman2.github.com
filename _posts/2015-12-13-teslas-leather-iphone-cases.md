Is it too late to add something to my Christmas list?

From [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/11/9891696/tesla-leather-iphone-case-6-plus):
> Yes, for $45, Tesla will let you wrap your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus with leather that was originally supposed to pad your bottom. (Or your back, I guess.) That's actually not a bad deal! Leather cases typically run close to the $50 mark as it is. Toss in another $5, and Tesla will add some credit card slots to the case, too. (The company claims that this version is capable of protecting against RFID readers as well.)

I like this.

I’m skeptical about [Photos&nbsp;for Mac](http://www.apple.com/osx/photos-preview/). The last time Apple made a photo editing product, no one used it (Aperture). I’m sure it’ll look best and work best on the highest end Macs with the best screens (Retina iMac).

Either way. I’ll probably give it a shot.

> Introducing Photos for OS X. Featuring an easy-to-use and streamlined design, Photos has been engineered from the ground up to help you keep your growing library organized and accessible. Powerful and intuitive editing tools help you perfect your images as well as create beautiful gifts for sharing. And with iCloud Photo Library, a lifetime’s worth of photos and videos can be stored in the cloud — so you can access your entire collection from your Mac or iOS devices anytime.

Apple has a new page on their site titled “ [Shot on iPhone 6](http://www.apple.com/iphone/world-gallery/).” This collection of photographs feature some of the best images taken with an iPhone 6. Of course, low light is still uncharted territory for the iPhone and you probably won’t see any of them in this mega gallery. I only got through roughly two dozen photos before I realized how long the list actually is.&nbsp;

For your [viewing pleasure](http://www.apple.com/iphone/world-gallery/).

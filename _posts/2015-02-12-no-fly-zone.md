[This](http://noflyzone.org) is [good news](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/noflyzone-database-will-tell-drones-not-to-fly-over-your-house/) for fans of privacy.

> Yesterday a new website and database launched called NoFlyZone.org, which invites people to enter their home address to prevent amateur drone pilots from zooming over their property, GoPro running. The database is maintained by a team of 10 people based in El Segundo, California, and led by Ben Marcus, a private pilot and drone operator.I have a pretty good idea what organizations wonâ€™t be using this database.

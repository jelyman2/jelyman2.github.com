The words “vacate” and “vacation” seem to have two very different connotations in our mind. Looking at news articles tells us just that.

 **Vacate:**

> Residents Forced To Vacate From Historic, Problem-Plagued Roseville Building— [CBS13 Sacramento](http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/02/01/residents-forced-to-vacate-from-historic-problem-plagued-roseville-building/)

 **Vacation:**

> He Saved For Months To Buy His Wife A Dream Vacation. Her Happy Tears Say It All— [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/02/man-surprises-wife-vacation-video_n_6595506.html)

See what I mean? It’s actually a bit difficult to find an article about someone vacating their location and heading to Hawai’i, Milan, or Costa Rica.

Karma can be so sweet.

via Stephanie Clifford and Andrew Pollack from the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/shkreli-fraud-charges.html):

> The indictment says that Mr. Shkreli ran three schemes.

> First, he is accused of lying to investors at MSMB Capital, which he ran from 2009 to 2012, about how well the fund was doing and how much money it had, and of falsely claiming that it had an independent auditor and administrator. He prevented investors from redeeming their money in MSMB Capital, again by lying about the fund’s performance. During this period, Mr. Shkreli “and others” were misusing the fund’s assets, the indictment said.

> He performed a similar scheme with MSMB Healthcare, which he ran in 2011 and 2012, the indictment alleges.

> Finally, he and Mr. Greebel inappropriately routed money from Retrophin “in an effort to satisfy Shkreli’s personal and unrelated professional debts and obligations,” the indictment said. Mr. Greebel was the lead outside counsel to Retrophin from 2012 to 2014, when he was a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman. His name appears on many of the Retrophin filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

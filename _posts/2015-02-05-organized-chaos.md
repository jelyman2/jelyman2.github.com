This is my writing space. One would think that with my constant writing and seemingly never ending list of things to talk about, I’d have a super clean and awesome space to write that wasn’t the least bit distracting. Turns out, I’m not a super huge fan of minimalist spaces. I like having things to look at. When I’m pondering, it gives me something to study that ultimately leads me to my words. My last post about Dr. Better came solely because I was drinking one and the bottle was sitting right next to me. I could do to clean it up a bit, but I don’t feel that’s a super high priority. If was to organize my chaos a bit, those flowers wouldn’t move. That’s my wife’s wedding bouquet. She makes the final say on where that sits, and I kindly oblige. (Plus, she shares the desk, too, on occasion, so it’s only fair.)

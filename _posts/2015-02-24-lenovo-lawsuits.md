Here they come!

from [ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/lenovo-users-lawyer-up-over-hole-filled-https-breaking-superfish-adware/):

> San Diego blogger&nbsp; [Jessica Bennett filed a lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1674514-gov-uscourts-casd-467335-1-0.html)&nbsp;in federal court last week, charging Lenovo and Superfish with violating state and federal wiretap laws, trespassing on personal property, and violating California’s unfair competition law. In addition to this,&nbsp; [a Pennsylvania law firm put out a press release](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150220005737/en/CONSUMER-COMPUTER-SECURITY-ALERT-Rosen-Law-Firm#.VOtkVPnF_6d)&nbsp;on Friday that asked Lenovo customers to participate in a class action lawsuit investigation regarding the presence of Superfish on their computers.

TAKE IT FROM ME.

It’s easy to give advice. It’s actually way too easy. Standing on the outside, looking in, it’s easy to observe, to judge. We compare someone and the pieces that make them whole to ourselves and our own components.

One thing we fail to do all too often is heed our own advice.

> do as I say, not as I do.

Those words were likely spoken by every parent to ever exist even so far as millennia past. We secretly swear but tell our children that such acts are bad. We teach that good [religious group] should regularly [reglion-based activity] but we fail to even keep par with the course.

I can sit here in front of my screen and bang on the keyboard in an attempt to preach to you about how you should [create better habits](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/life-changes/) and how you should do that extra good thing every day and how you should [stop shoveling shit](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/naturebox/) for food into your grub hole every day.

I’d be a damn hypocrite if I did that. There’s a fine line between sharing good ideas and things that sound like they’d be worthwhile and preaching them as gospel and it’s hard to see when&nbsp;initially observed.

Take it from me. There are times when I want to tell the world how awesome it is to [get up early](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half/) in the morning, sit down, and kick some creative ass, all before breakfast, except I can’t manage to do that, myself, right now. So I don’t. I use to. I used to tout how awesome it was, regularly.

Back then, though, I did it. Every single day. I woke up between 3:30 and 4:00 A.M., hopped in the shower, made coffee, and sat down with enough time for almost an hour of un-interrupted creativity and morning reflection.

> take care of your own yard before you start criticizing your neighbor’s.

I refuse to tout what I don’t follow or believe, myself. I think it’s important to [nut up or shut up](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/on-accepting/). I know [struggling](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/) with [inspiration](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/) is real. I’ve discovered [creativity](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/) comes to those who [hunt it down](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/) like a rabid wolf hunts a juicy deer. I know what it’s like to [have your mind](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/) in the [wrong place](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/).

Most of all, I know [making excuses](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/incapacity/) is for the weak. The [professional](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/professional-life-liver/) doesn’t [make an excuse](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/magic/). Take it from me.

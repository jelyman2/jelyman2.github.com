It’s been hard watching interested parties inquire about my now-retired Macbook Pro. It may just be a computer, but that computer got me through numerious job searches, it travelled a thousand miles, lived in eight homes, and more.

I never thought I’d end up being so sentimental about it. I bought this computer before I met my wife, even. It just goes to show how fast time flies.

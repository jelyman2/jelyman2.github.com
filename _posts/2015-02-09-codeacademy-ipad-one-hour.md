One thing I’m working on is improving my software development skills. In 2015, along with everything else, I want to be much better at programming and development. One tool I used when I first started, and revisited again last night, was [CodeAcademy on the iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-code-hour/id762950096?mt=8). A great app that teaches you the super basics so other languages don’t seem so daunting. It’s free, and anyone can use it. Give it a whirl and [download it from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-code-hour/id762950096?mt=8). I mentioned it was free, right?

When you’re done, visit their [full site](http://codeacademy.com) and start learning more advanced stuff. If you’re totally new to coding, start with [HTML](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web). In this day and age, it never hurts to know it. If you’ve already been through all of their stuff and want more, check out the post I wrote not too long ago listing other great sources for learning to code.&nbsp;

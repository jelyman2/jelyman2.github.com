Typically when I wake up in the morning I don’t have many worthwhile thoughts until well into mid-morning (weekdays) or mid-day (weekends/holidays). Today was supposed to be the latter (New Years Day, a holiday for me) but when I woke up this morning, I realized something shortly after I (while still in bed) grabbed my iPad Mini and started checking emails: I’m deep in the Apple ecosystem.

## The Mac Daddy.
Technically this isn’t a completely new revelation and not a statement of fact surrounding something that just happened overnight. I bought my first apple product in 2011 when I bought the Mid-2011 Macbook Pro 15″. While I had used Apple computers before (mostly the white, CRT and first LCD 27″ iMac), I wasn’t super familiar with them. What really convinced me to buy was my job at the time gave me a Mac to use as my daily workhorse (A 13″ Macbook Air) and I found my level of enjoyment increasing every day. I took it home for a while and played with it, doing personal stuff on it and just really enjoyed the experience.

I caved about a month later and bought my own Mac. This experience also included the initial sticker shock of spending $2300 (sales tax in Washington State was, at the time, 8.3%… ouch). I was quietly praying and hoping that this investment would last–I was totally right–and I wouldn’t regret it.

The time I spent with my work-issued Macbook Air gave me time to realize that the computer I use as my daily driver doesn’t need all the tweaking, customization, and granular control over its components like my at-the-time gaming desktop PC did. I couldn’t care less which brand of motherboard I had, nor if I had the maximum amount of RAM I could possibly stuff. I wanted a machine that I could fire up and have just work. I didn’t know this at the time but that idea would end up being my mantra for future device purchases to come.

## iPhone, uPhone, weallPhone.
Not more than a couple months later, my second step into the Apple pool came with the release of the iPhone 4S. I had already seen the iPhone 4 being used daily by several co-workers and they couldn’t stop drooling and chanting and raving about it. I bit the bullet, renewed my contract with Verzion Wireless, and a couple weeks later (a week earlier than my estimated delivery date), my shiny new phone arrived.

I was changing things up from the Motorola Droid X I previously owned. Before the X I had never owned a smartphone so I was still fairly green in the space. I didn’t quite know what to do first: do I listen to music? Do I watch something? I wonder how much of my iTunes library I can fit on this thing?

Making the move from Android to iOS was a bit jarring at first, but I can’t go without mentioning that the move was also bittersweet. I enjoyed the fact that I could practically do whatever the hell I wanted to my Droid X, but at the same time, I hated that. When I first made the transition, I switched back and forth a couple times just to make sure I really wanted to change mobile ecosystems. Every time I would go back to Android (version 2.2.3 was the latest version at the time for smartphones), I would find something else I hated-but-didn’t-know-it. First it was the battery life, then it was the lag, then it was lack of quality apps, then it was music management. All of these little things stacked up quickly and within just a couple of weeks, I had tossed my Droid X out for good. I never sold it. I just _threw it away_ (read: recycled it) using the pre-paid package Verizon sent with my iPhone. I cared zero about getting any money out of it because I hated it that much at the end. I vowed to never buy an android device again (for a few years; more on that later.)

## Fast Forward.
As the calendar peeled away, 2011 became 2012, 2012 became 2013, and all the while, I was happy as a clam with my iPhone 4S, then subsequently the iPhone 5. The taller screen was a good move by Apple, as it allowed for more vertical space for reading as well as more horizontal real estate to push those YouTube pixels in your face. The introduction of white wasn’t that bad, either–I bought it.

Towards the middle of 2013, though, a foreign player came into the game and toyed with my idea of what a great phone should be. This mystical beast of smartphone lore was the Samsung Galaxy S4.

### Greener Grass… or something like that.
I liked the idea of the Galaxy S4. It was a bigger phone (5.0″ screen), 1080P resolution, thin almost to the point of anorexia, and lighter than helium, it seemed. It reeled me in with it’s flashiness and promises of being modern and able to help me get all my stuff done better than Apple ever could. Because I’m weak, I caved and bought it.

Let me save you the misery of hearing all about it and skip to the end of this side-story: I dumped it four months later. See, Android and the phones they run on are like conjoined twins: you can’t have one without the other. I enjoyed the hardware that made up the GS4, but hated Android. If I cut one half off, the other would be useless (a.k.a dead in my anatomy analogy). All the things I hated about Android were still true three years later: Even at version 4.0 or whatever the hell it was, music management was fragmented (Google Play Music barf), battery life sucked ( **IDLING** for six hours doesn’t constitute 80% usage of my battery) thanks to the ominous horse-shit that was the Google Services Framework that I couldn’t control, inability to control my apps and their desire to do whatever the hell they wanted whenever the hell they wanted with stuff like GPS, Bluetooth, etc. The _only_ thing that seemed to improve was lag. Android was snappy in its UI, but also snappy like a real housewife of New Jersey. Once I realized nothing had ultimately changed, I couldn’t sell it fast enough. There’s some poor soul out there who traded me their iPhone 5 for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I hope they haven’t killed themselves because of how depressing Android makes people feel.

## Tablets. An Interpretive Dance.
I still have that iPhone 5 roughly a year and change later, and will eventually invest in an iPhone 6 (or whatever is the latest and greatest when I decide to buy). For the holidays, though, my wife and I decided we needed a slightly larger format for mobile entertainment and have been thinking about tablets for some time. We (literally) instructed everyone to supply Apple Store gift cards as christmas gifts because we wanted iPads. That was it. Unless they felt so inclined to buy one outright, that was their only other option. Anything less was failure (not really). With a supply of gift cards in hand (12 to be exact), we hit up the Apple Store the day after Christmas (Boxing Day!) and aquired two of Apple’s finest iPad Minis.

My wife insisted on getting a gold tablet and while I tend to always want the latest version of whatever exists, I couldn’t validate spending +$100 on TouchID. Her case was valid, as the iPad Mini 2 doesn’t come in gold. I opted for the Space Gray and minus the TouchID, my Mini 2 is technically identical to the Mini 3 she purchased.

I don’t understand why I waited so long to purchase an iPad. It’s an amazing device that fits the mantra I operate by to this day when it comes to my daily-use home technology: it should just work. The level of craftsmanship is evident even more so in the apps released for it these days. I’m a huge fan of Blizzard’s Hearthstone and Super Evil Megacorp’s Vain Glory. I’m confident there would be some little thing that would screw up an otherwise good experience if I was to purchase an Android tablet.

## From a High Level I See.
All of my communication devices are Apple products. I wrote this story on the same mac I bought in 2011 (which is still kicking serious ass to this day, totally justifying the purchase price), I interact on social media and play games with my iPad, and I listen to music and podcasts while I commute with my iPhone. Each device is similar yet serves different, defined purposes. I rarely play games on my iPhone or my Mac. When I do, it’s Dots 2 or Minecraft, respectively. I also don’t sit on Facebook or Twitter much on my Mac, while I do more so on my iDevices. I don’t listen to music on my iPad or my Mac because I don’t commute with those devices and commuting is the only time I really can tune out and enjoy music (I ride public transportation; tuning out while driving is dangerous, kids.)

This is an arrangement that I love and that works well for me. The Apple ecosystem has pulled me in (although I pretty much went willingly) and has crafted combined experiences for me that I find quite desireable. I don’t use iCloud for anything, though, so there’s that. I’ve had GMail since 2007 and changing email addresses is too much work when there’s no impending doom if I don’t.

## The Future
My current arrangement won’t likely change any time soon. I already learned my lesson when I tried to deviate from the plan of the Apple gods. They quietly warned me and I chose to ignore; I doubt I’ll be doing that again. I have zero prospects of purchasing or building a daily-usage Windows PC. If I choose to get back into PC gaming, I might visit it, but with whatever casual gaming I do being targeted towards the PlayStation, there’s little chance that idea will actually come to fruition as another tech product in my home. OS X has been and continues to be a great operating system to work with. I use Windows at work and while it definitely has familiarity on its side and can handle more businessy-corporatey stuff, I would hate to use it at home: too much disparity at this point. Windows Phone will never be an option for me: the ecosystem is barely alive as it is. Developers aren’t interested enough produce let alone maintain quality apps.

My tech nest is solid. I plan on keeping it that way.

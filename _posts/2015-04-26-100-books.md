[Amazon](//amazon.com) came out with what equates to a bucket list for books. Their [100 Books to Read in a Lifetime](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=8192263011) features a load of great reads crossing all genres and categories. I’ve only read maybe a handful from this list, so perhaps it’s time to start a book club?

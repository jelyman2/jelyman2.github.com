I spent some time scouring GitHub this afternoon looking for cool projects. One I stumbled upon was a tool created by Vox Media for creating Twitter cards and Instagram images that included text, source, and site brand logo. I thought it was pretty interesting so I gave it a look-see and started it up in my own space.

I’m not sure if it’ll serve me much purpose and I haven’t seen Vox use it much if at all lately. It might have been a one-time use tool, probably around election time. If you’re interested in giving it a whirl, check it out their [GitHub page](https://github.com/voxmedia/meme "Meme on Vox Media's GitHub page"), their [running example](http://www.sbnation.com/a/meme), or my [running example](http://mg.tools.jlyman.net).

One thing I’m not sure they totally get is that these image aren’t quite memes. [These](http://knowyourmeme.com) are memes.

I picked up The Martian by way of a recommendation a friend gave me. I’ve seen it on the shelf for a minute now and I’m pretty excited to start listening to it. Most books I don’t read (a [recent purchase](http://jlyman.net/turning-pro) being an exception) but instead listen to via Audible. If you’re not an Audible user, give them a shot. Like everything else I recommend, I am an Audible user and greatly enjoy their service. If you want a listen along with me, [click here](http://go.jlyman.net/audibleft30) to sign up for a free trial and get a **two** free books to keep, even if you hate the service. I’ll be updating occasionally, like a digital book club of sorts, as I progress through the book. I’m excited!

 **Update:&nbsp;** Turns out my info was a bit off. Instead of a free audiobook, you get&nbsp; **two** free audiobooks. Oops!

I want to pass on that I’m aware of all the missing images a lot of my posts have. Somewhere during an image processing sweep a lot of them never finished and thus are now basically invalid files. I’m working on restoring them. No need to email me ![:)](https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

We all want to be smarter. Thomas Oppong put together a [list](https://medium.com/keep-learning-keep-growing/33-websites-that-will-make-you-a-genius-53c5114c1d3d) of 33 Web sites that we all can use to become geniuses.

> “I have no special talent, I am only passionately curious.” – Albert EinsteinA few of my favorites from his list:

- [University of the People](http://www.uopeople.org/) – having educational opportunities that reach beyond online video courses is fantastic.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) – this one is always on every list I make regarding top educational resources.
- [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/) – knowing more about how the markets work and personal finance can _never_ be a bad thing.
- [Mental Floss](http://mentalfloss.com/) – great for learning about some of the cooler topics science, culture, and society.
- [In a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q) – while not technically on the list, this YouTube channel put together by some german graphic artists covers a wide array of topics in a way anyone can understand, with awesome visuals.
- [C.G.P. Grey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) – also not technically on the list, however as an educational YouTube resource, Grey tops that list, if there is one.

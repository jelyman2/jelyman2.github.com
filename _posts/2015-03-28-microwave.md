I chuckled at this one, because the struggle is real.

However, it got me to thinking. What are some of the small things in life that are actually quite enjoyable and satisfying?

I think for me, one of the most satisfying small things is when I sit down to write, I have this sudden flow of words, as if they came out of nowhere. I don’t have to look at my list of things I want to talk about, I don’t have to browse the Internet looking for inspiration.

It just happens.

Is it possible to be bored of the sun?

Maybe it’s not that I’m bored of seeing the sun every day. Maybe it’s that I’m just drying out.

As you’re probably well aware, [I’m from Seattle](http://johnathanlyman.com/about/). I grew up in the Seattle metro area and spent my entire life there. Only recently did I [end up moving](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/moving-to-cali/). Of all places I could have moved, I landed in Northern California. I did so because the next phase in my wife’s professional life was upon her and it’s only fair that [I support her](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/being-a-great-leader/). [She supports me](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support/) on a daily basis, as well.

We [moved into](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-4/) our apartment on April 7. Since then, it’s rained twice for roughly a total of 1.75 inches. As of today, we’ve been here a month… 30 days to be exact.

Did I mention it was April?

Where I come from, 1.75” is a weekly thing in April.

Not in California. Apparently we’re all going to [die of thirst](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/04/1318778/-California-is-dying-of-thrist-while-it-uses-much-of-its-precious-water-to-raise-livestock-in-China), if the media is to be believed.

People keep asking me if I’m enjoying the nice weather. I tell them I am, because it’s true. I’m really enjoying not having to wear a jacket all the time. I’m enjoying being able to wear shorts.

But the weather might be boring me. I’m not really bored of the sun, per se, just bored of the same thing every day.

Granted, Seattle gets a lot more rain and many I’m sure would argue that having “blah” for weather nine months out of the year sucks.

Which it does. But it doesn’t happen all at once.

But as I write this, I’m starting to ponder the idea that maybe it’s not even that I’m bored of seeing the same thing every day when I look out the window. Maybe it’s that I’m just not used to seeing the same blue sky every day in April and May.

This kind of weather typically showed up in July in Seattle. That’s my birthday month. It’s a good time of the year.

April’s been historically miserable outside. May is so-so.

I have some changing to do.

I need to keep this tan going.

I need to embrace the sun.

I’m thirsty.

Ever since I discovered Docker, Iâ€™ve been a fan. Trying to explain Docker to the un-initiated is also fun. I describe it like so:

> Docker is like a Lunchable (or bento box). The container of said Lunchable is Docker and the VM it controls. Every section inside the container is each of the apps it runs.I try to tell folks that you use a Virtual Machine if you need to control an entirely specific environment. You use Docker if your interest is just with apps. In this day and age, trying to maintain a fleet of systems or virtual machines can be daunting.

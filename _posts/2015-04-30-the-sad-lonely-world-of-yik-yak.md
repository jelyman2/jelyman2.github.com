So I downloaded what some are calling the winner of the Secret-Whisper-YikYak battle for anonymous sharing. YikYak works like Whisper and Secret, except there’s one thing very different about it, at least from what I can tell.

After spending just ten minutes on the app, a trend started appearing. Actually, several trends. If you struggle with any of the following:

- Boys
- Periods
- Love
- ADHD Drugs
- General Sadness
- High School
- Drinking
- High School Drinking
- General High School Sadness
- Awkward First-Time Sex
- Awkward Butt Stuff
Then Yik Yak is for you. Ask your doctor about high-strength Yik Yak that involes constantly commenting on stranger’s life struggles with your own quips that likely have a nominal effect.

One thing I noticed with Secret is that people seemed to as least be older than 15. I never tried Whisper so who knows what whack stuff went on there.

So when it comes to YikYak…

Enjoy. I think…

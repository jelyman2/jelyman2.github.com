A great [post on Medium](https://medium.com/bloc-posts/how-can-i-learn-to-code-8a627847549a#.1p9g24lt5) from Roshan Choxi, the co-founder and CEO of [Bloc](http://www.bloc.io/), one of the premiere remote coding bootcamps out there[^1].

> If you focus on building the habit of programming for 20â€“30 hours a week, you will reach your goal of being a web developer. If you focus on the goal of being a web developer in X months, you get nothing from that but stress and insecurity about how far along you are.

If you're in the same boat as I, it's definitely worth a read. 

[^1]: I should know, I'm in it.

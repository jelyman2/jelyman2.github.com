It’s been roughly 40 days since I started writing on a continual basis. Some days have been more productive than others. There are days when all I manage to come up with are posts about other things going on in the world. I have enjoyed being able to just sit down and discuss what’s on my mind.&nbsp;When I sit down and talk about something that’s on my mind I end up writing a boat load of words. These [two](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill) [posts](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades) are good examples. The first covered [project management buzzwords](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill) and the second covers a [god-awful movie](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades).

There is one thing I do more now than I ever did before. I think about what I want to talk about tomorrow. When something appears in my head I determine if it is good fodder for my blog. I don’t have a real direction for my blog just yet. This will change with time. For now I focus on writing and discussing topics I find important. I know someone out there will find them to be interesting. Perhaps they’ll share what they read with their friends.&nbsp;I won’t ever know if they don’t like them because I don’t use post comments. I decided comments were useless.&nbsp;They don’t contribute to my blogging experience in the least bit.&nbsp;

One more cool thing has happened. I didn’t use a comma in this whole post.

Real quickly I wanted to give a shoutout to my wife. She’s the one in the image above.

We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary last weekend and it also roughly marked the point where we started dating three and a half years ago.

She’s been my best support system throughout all of this. I’d go anywhere for her—and in fact I [already](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/scared-to-act) [am](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/be-ready). I can’t want for what life holds in store for us in the next several years as we make our way to California and spend the better part of a decade there.

It’ll be a grand new adventure for the both of us, likely more so for me as I’ve never lived outside the state of Washington.

Thanks, Kaysze, you’re the best wife a man could ever ask for ![:)](https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

It wouldn’t be a groundbreaking moment in history unless an opposing political party starting whining and groaning and stomping their feet until they get their way.

> US Rep.&nbsp;Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) today filed legislation to overturn the&nbsp; [municipal broadband decision](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/fcc-overturns-state-laws-that-protect-isps-from-local-competition/)&nbsp;the Federal Communications Commission made earlier in the day.Let’s keep in mind this isn’t net neutrality overall, just the ruling the FCC made regarding a [municipality’s ability to expand](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/fcc-overturns-state-laws-that-protect-isps-from-local-competition/) outside their designated territory.

If someone didn’t contact, I’d be surprised.

If you want to read the whole act titled “States’ Rights Municipal Broadband Act of 2015,”&nbsp; [here you go](http://blackburn.house.gov/uploadedfiles/states_rights_muni_broadband_act.pdf).

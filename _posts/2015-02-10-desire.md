My desire to write continues to grow. When I first start at the beginning of the year, I was writing once a day, and I felt like that wouldn’t be sustainable so I [told myself](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart "Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year") I would write a few times a week. Turns out, I enjoy it a lot more than I thought I did. Writing has given me an opportunity to not just put my thoughts on digital paper and share with the world, but be able to look back at things that happened over the last day or so and reflect on them if I feel said topics are important. I have a [great app](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/311/desk-overview "Just Sit Down and Write with Desk") to write with, and fortunately my wife support me. It’s hard to say if I’d ever make it a career but as it stands right now, I could write about stuff for hours.

Who knows what 2015 will hold. The summer will bring a whole host of [new changes and new experiences](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/246/scared-to-act "Scared to Act") for my family and I’m excited and terrified, but mostly excited.

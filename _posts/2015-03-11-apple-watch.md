The Apple Watch was formally announced on Monday. Part of me cares, part of me doesn’t.

I like the idea of the Apple Watch. I like the way the stainless steel watch with the metal link band looks. I buy regular watches that look like that. Too bad it’s $1000.

It’ll be hard for me to justify that kind of price tag. I look at what the Apple Watch allegedly can do, and I think to myself that I’d never use any of that. I like the idea of fitness trackers, and I like watches. If the Apple Watch was half the price, if I could get the watch I described for $500, instead, I’d buy it.

Because I can’t, though, I’m looking for alternatives. This is where [Withings](http://withings.com) comes in.

I’m really enjoying the look of the Activité. It’s a simple device that does exactly what I want at a price tag that’s reasonable. The analog style is great and the battery life is outstanding.

I’ve never 100% liked having a watch on one hand, and a FitBit on the other. I like my FitBit, but I’d like to wear it on my left arm… except my watch is there.

I smell a birthday gift to myself coming soon.

If my wife ever reads this: Wife, this is what I want for my birthday.

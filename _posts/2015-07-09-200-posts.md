I published my 200th blog post for the year, just [a bit ago](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed), with a [review](http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed) of the free markdown editing app [Writed](http://writed.io). It’s crazy to think that starting in [January](http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/), up until today, [July 9th](http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/), I’ve written 200 blog posts (with this one being #201).

I’m not entirely sure what the next 200 posts will hold, but I hope to be able to get them in before the end of the year. There’s a tad less than 1/2 of the calendar year to go so I’m looking at quite a challenge, but I was able to start strong in the beginning of the year so there’s no excuse why I can’t sit down and bust out 200 different things I want to talk about.

I have a lot on my mind.

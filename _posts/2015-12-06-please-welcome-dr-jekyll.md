It's taken a while for me to mentally get to this point but today I finally crossed the threshold and converted my blog into one generated by Jekyll. Essentially, every time I post or make a change, the blog is rebuilt into static files making the load on my server super light as well as saving disk space. On top of it all, I really wanted to tinker with the idea.

There were a few reasons why I finally bit the bullet and I wanted to share them in hopes that one day someone will stumble across this post and finally take the plunge like I did.

1. **WordPress is getting kinda fat**. I've seen fatter CMSes (anyone remember PostNuke-- the year 2002 was fun.) As someone who's getting more and more into software development and tinkering with code in general, WordPress is a beast I don't want to tackle, to be honest.

2. **I really only need a couple features**. And one of those is a blog. It's pretty easy to do that with just about anything and with the level of potential complexity[^1] that WordPress can introduce.

3. **Comments, psh.**. I can't think of a time when I *really* wanted to have comments on blog posts. I only did it on WordPress because I honestly felt like I should. Now that I'm in complete control and this blog serves more of a purpose of me saying things and people consuming that information, comments sections aren't really necessary. If you want to comment on something, send me an [email](/contact).

4. **I feel more developer-y**. I don't know if *not* using WordPress is a requirement for this one but it just feels right. I really enjoyed the setup process and learned a lot about the whole thing. Granted I have a bit of experience with [Ruby](https://github.com/search?l=Ruby&q=user%3Ajelyman2&ref=searchresults&type=Repositories&utf8=âœ“), already, which really helped in troubleshooting.

So with all that being said, here it is. Every time I update, I push the new files to both a [GitHub repo](http://jelyman2.github.io) and my server at the same time[^2] so I have redundancy and it's an easy way to show off what i'm doing to make this site interesting using a popular static site generator.

Over the next couple weeks, I'll be sure to share any unique experiences I had and what I learned from them so stay tuned!

[^1]: Not always a bad thing, mind you.

title: WordPress to Jekyll Post Converter

> Work in Progress.

### Description

This rather simple Ruby script pings the REST API on a self-hosted WordPress site, gets post data, and converts it into .md (markdown) files for use in Jekyll blogs.

I build this out of necessity since the Jekyll export plugin for WordPress hasn't worked in many months and I couldn't find any easy to use pre-built tools out on the interwebs.

The code is clunky, I'll admit, but it did what I needed it to do and it processed 252 posts in less than 10 seconds. Not bad for a couple hours work, if you ask me.

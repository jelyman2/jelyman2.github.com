## Description

Quickly build out .md files inside `_posts` for your Jekyll blogs.

I wrote this tool because I found it to be too time consuming to keep a blank `.md` template somewhere, open it, then save it in the proper location. With this tool, all a user needs to do is answer the prompts and they're good to go.

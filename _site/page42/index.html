    <p>What’s the point of having ad blocking software if it doesn’t block any ads? Good question.</p>

        To Write, You Must Read

    <blockquote>
  <p>“If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot…reading is the creative center of a writer’s life…you cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you.” ~ Stephen KingArguably one of the best fantasy and sci-fi writers of all time with almost four hundred different works written including such epic titles as Carrie, Salem’s Lot, It, Mr. Mercedes, Revival, and more, Stephen Kind makes a great point. With the onslaught of bite-sized media coming at us from all angles (tweets, status updates, Instagram photos) it’s now mainstream to only spend a few minutes reading about any particular topic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll admit, I enjoy bite-sized news as much as the next guy. When I’m checking social media, I’m doing it for one of two reasons: to get a quick update on the day and the world around me and to find something interesting to read about later. The key is the latter. I think if more people sat down and read a book (or at least listened to one), or even consumed more thoughtful and substantial information via something like a Podcast or another educational resource (a single-topic magazine, for example), we’d be overflowing with creativity as a people. Don’t get me wrong, there are loads of creative people in the world, already, and that’s awesome. But there are so many people that have so much to share, but don’t, for one reason or another. </p>

<p>What would have happened if Stephen King never published any of his works because he didn’t feel like they were interesting or he was a good enough writer? You never know who’ll come across your work someday, and in order to be good at writing, one has to be good at reading. I’ve consumed quite a few of Stephen King’s books, personally, and while I started writing for several reasons, his writing stimulated my creative juices in part just enough to help me get to the point where I write something every day of the week. </p>

    <p>I’ve always pondered how much more productive I would be if I had a “dream office” to write and work in. Then I’ve thought about what that office would look like. In reality, I’m not exactly sure I could even come up with a solid example, just some abstract ideas. I sat down for a few minutes to ponder this. </p>

<p>What would your perfect writing/reading/working space look and feel like?</p>

<p>In my world, my writing space would have hard wood floors. Something dark, but not cherry or mahogany dark. I’d need a rolling chair, something that would support my back so I can sit upright. On my desk, I’d need a setup that allowed me to look straight ahead at my monitor or monitors and not have to tilt my head downward. I don’t know if I’d have a laptop, still, or switch to an iMac or similar. The desk itself would likely be minimalist in style, with maybe a drawer or small cabinet underneath to keep the clutter to a minimum. </p>

<p>I would need to have something playing music, probably a small speaker set behind me, nothing too loud or big so as to be distracting. A bookshelf would be nice, to hold all the books I don’t have (I’ll need to buy some books). I feel like the room would need a lot of light either from a window, from lighting fixtures, or both. The lighting can’t be harsh, though. When I’m up writing at 4:30 AM, the last thing I need is harsh light to work with. </p>

<p>Outside of that, I’d have to figure it out as I go along. Perhaps I can find some sort of genie in a magic bottle to grant me this writing space. </p>

    <p>I was looking over all the writing I did for the month of January and I can safely say that not only have I kept one of my New Year’s Resolutions so far, but I blew away my person goal I set for myself. I made a pact with inner me that I would write at least a few times a week and have them be something substantial. According to my count, I posted something 39 times in January and have over 20,000 words to show for it. By that count, with only spending roughly an hour a day writing, I could have a complete book written in a month if I wrote all day. Granted, I don’t have the attention span to do something like that but it makes me feel good to know that I’ve been able to not only meet a goal but to exceed it by a wide margin. <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/249/for-february">I told myself a couple weeks ago</a> that I would write more in February. In reality, the goals has essentially become “write the same amount as you’re currently doing in February.” Writing is something I enjoy quite a bit and have no intent on stopping.</p>

        Harry&#8217;s: Get a Good Shave Without Nicking Your Wallet
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-02-01T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">01 Feb 2015</time>

    <p>To follow up my quick review of NatureBox yesterday, I received a second awesome package in the mail on Saturday. I recently ordered a new shave kit from a great company I hadn’t heard of until just recently called Harry’s. Harry’s does things a bit differently. Their claim to fame is they make all their own blades and firmly believe that charging a boat load of cash for a single replacement razor blade is dumb. Here’s what I thought of the kit when I first received it.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1-000585039a409a575b2f9ef2714edc4c.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>I ordered the basic Truman set in dark blue. Other colors include orange,white, and green. With the kit, I received two extra blades, a blade protector, and shave cream (the image above shows gel, which is also an option). Everything I need to get started. Since I already have after-shave that I really like, I opted out of ordering some, for now. </p>

<p>When the box arrived, it showed up in the mail. I could have ordered faster shipping but I think with enough foresight and planning, one could save money and still have their kit or replacement equipment show up on time. (more on their subscription option later).</p>

<p>I opened the box and the first thing I did was pull out the razor. With a blade pre-attached, I essentially had three blades at my disposal. The handle has some heft to it and I really like that. It’s curved and feels good in my hand. </p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1_harrys-delivery-002.png?resize=882%2C588" alt="" /></p>

<p>The shaving cream I opted for smells great and while the tube isn’t very large, it’s enough to get started. I don’t have to continue using their cream or gel if I don’t want, but who knows, I might go for it with their subscription options.</p>

<h2 id="subscribe-to-a-smooth-face">Subscribe to a Smooth Face</h2>
<p>If you’re a regular shaver, be it daily, every other day, or weekly, they have an option that’ll suit your needs. To prevent you from running out of razors, shaving cream, and after-shave, Harry’s will send you everything you need in the right intervals, automatically. Based on how often you shave, they’ll ship you two creams and eight blades every two, three, or five months for $31.00, or you can sign up for your own interval and include gel and aftershave at the interval you choose. ﻿Where else do you know that you can get eight high-quality blade cartridges for less $1.88 each and get shave cream or gel for $8 each? Good question.</p>

<p>Go sign up now with <a href="http://harrys.com">Harry’s</a> and get equipment for a great shave for a great price.</p>

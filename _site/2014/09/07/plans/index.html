  <p><em>Why it’s not the end of the world and sometimes you just need to suck it up.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ad·ven·ture (n.) — an unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity.I’m a landscape photographer when I’m not studying or working at my day job in IT. My free time is limited but when I have the ability to go on an adventure with my gear I take it. Sometimes, I take a wrong turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With summer coming to an end, I know I only have a few weekends left before fall rolls in and crushes my hopes of a great sunset somewhere new, or awesome weather patterns. See, here in the State of Washington, Fall looks a hell of a lot like this:</p>

<figure id="attachment_128" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-128 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04-1024x768.jpg?resize=882%2C662" alt="Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>That freaking sucks. Granted, that photo was taken in Denmark, but Denmark and the Pacific Northwest are pretty close to the same latitudinal line. From October to May, Washington is usually a variation of the above, with a day or two here and there with awesome weather.</p>

<p>My most recent attempt and wrapping up summer on a high note ended in failure. It was frustrating. I was pissed, but at the same time, I had no right to be. There was not a good reason why I was as frustrated as I felt after realizing I took a terribly wrong turn an hour after I made it.</p>

<p>But I was upset, nonetheless. Good thing I had cell service to look up an alternate route.</p>

<p>Oh wait.</p>

<p>I didn’t.</p>

<p>Crap.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>Do I turn around or keep going?</p>

<p>Where the hell am I?</p>

<p>My original goal was to arrive at the Johnston Ridge Observatory on the northwest side of the mountain. Instead, I ended up at the end of a road on the south side of the mountain. Good thing I didn’t blow a tire… or run out of gas.</p>

<p>Here’s where my frustration kicks in. Once I realize I’m nowhere near where I want to be, I lose my cool. I got off Interstate 5 about twenty miles too early and there’s no other way to get around the mountain than by backtracking all the way to said freeway. Not only that, but I’m missing my window that I Wanted to arrive by and unless a miracle happens (which none did), I won’t make it at all.</p>

<p>After turning around and driving back the way I came, in search of a cell signal to verify the sinking suspicion I already had, it hits me that this whole problem is really my fault. I wasted the opportunity. I dragged my wife—who is already very tired from a long day with family—to the middle of nowhere only to turn around and go home with <em>zero</em> to show for it. My wife tries to apologize and while I appreciate her empathy and consideration for how important photography is to me, she did nothing wrong.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-hell-did-we-end-up-here">How The Hell Did We End Up Here?</h3>
<p>Well I’ll tell you. See, when you search for “Mt. St. Helens” on Google Maps, you get <em>exactly</em> what you searched for. It drops a pin smack freaking dab in the middle of the mountain.</p>

<p>But guess what? that’s not where I want to go. See I want to go a bit north, to the end of highway 504 (at the top of the image above). Where did Google Maps decide we need to go to reach out destination? About half-way between the pin on the map and the Swift Resivoir at the bottom of the image. Guess what’s out there?  <strong>Nothing</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t know this was taking place, however, when I asked my wife and adventure co-pilot to get directions to Mt. St. Helens. What I <em>should</em> have asked was to get directions to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, which is exactly where I want to go. Did my wife know that? No. Typically she knows what I tell her because she trusts me and trusts the fact that I know what I’m doing—I’m supposed to be a professional. Reason two why I’m pissed off.</p>

<p>To top it all off, I’m already freakin’ tired, myself, and knowing that I just blew two hours of daylight driving to and from the middle of nowhere makes reason number three.</p>

<h3 id="nut-up-and-write-it-off-as-another-learning-experience">Nut up and write it off as another learning experience.</h3>
<p>You can never have too many of those, and that’s the conclusion I’ve come to. Beyond my frustration, there was regular me understanding that making sure the plan is not only in existence but is correct is quite important. Any adventure you take needs to have some sort of plan, unless the goal is merely to wander without purpose. (You can’t wander with purpose, just so we’re clear).</p>

<p>For next time, I know that when I set my route (or my co-pilot in life and in the car, my wonderful wife does it for me), it’s important to make sure that the destination is correct. Everything that happens in the meantime is up in the air and I’m fine with that; that’s what makes an adventure, an adventure.</p>

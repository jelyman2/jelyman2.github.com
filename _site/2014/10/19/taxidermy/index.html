  <p>I wanted so badly to be wrong…</p>

<p>But unfortunately I wasn’t. Apparently, the phrase ‘ten dollars’ lines up with ‘taxidermy’ more than I wanted. I’m an IT guy and a Photographer, what the hell do I know about taxidermy?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-taxidermy">What Is Taxidermy?</h3>
<p>Dead Animals. Scraped clean. Ever carved a pumpkin? Kinda like that. No sharpies, though.</p>

<figure id="attachment_102" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test.jpg"><img class="wp-image-102 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test-1024x832.jpg?resize=882%2C717" alt="Probably common taxidermy tools... who knows." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Probably common taxidermy tools… who knows.</figcaption></figure>
<p> </p>

<h3 id="here-kitty-kitty">Here Kitty Kitty…</h3>
<p>It’s probably not a coincidence that the idea of small animals having the contents of their body cavity evacuated like Chernobyl never to be occupied by substantial living things again comes up with my cat sitting next to me while I write this. While horrible on at least several different levels, I’d have a good moment of insane laughter if my wife came home to find the cat sitting on the couch as it is now, but staring with cold and soul-less marbles for eyes. Meow kitty kitty… not. Fluffy got stuffed.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ" />Sometimes the only way to find out if it’s dead is to poke it. I don’t suggest you use your hands, though. Those little fox things have some sharp teeth. Good taxidermy looks like the animal is still alive. While I’m not sure that’s for everyone; those who scare easily might want to stick to simple creatures that when you walk into a dark living room at 2AM, you don’t end up staining the carpet with your fecies. There might be an inherent “turd fee” involved for the more aggressive stuffed animals.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p> </p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1lzOD7faBv6kv9RkQXi3A2g-300x210.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*lzOD7faBv6kv9RkQXi3A2g" />Like in all professions, you end up working with someone who’s less than professional. In the case of Mr. Leopard to the left, I’m sure whomever worked on him was a true professional, and the owner of this taxidermous monument was quite excited when he got exactly what he asked for: “I need it to look like a weiner dog that got scared. Mmmk? Thanks!”</p>

<h3 id="the-what-the-f">The ‘What the F…’</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw" />It really didn’t take long to find a WTF example. I was expecting it to take at least three minutes to find an image that really portrays the message I’m trying to convey in this measly paragraph. Unfortunately, I was wrong… again. Sometimes I hate being wrong. I really do. I also wish that sometimes I would hope for the inverse of what I really want so when my new expectations are met, I can feel better about myself. Anti-drinking prevention tip #28.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And now… let’s weave the writing prompt in just a touch more.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-i-get-for-ten-dollars">What Can I Get for Ten Dollars?</h3>
<p>That’s actually a lot harder of a question to answer than I originally thought. Doing a few Google searches in my underwear really only amounts to the most archaic form of finding information with the least amount of effort involved but we’re not all meant to have our noses shoved into books like Charlie Sheen shoved his nose into his… not books… made of powder.</p>

<p>Turns out I had to broaden my horizons a bit, which, while it broadens the idea of ‘taxidermy’ in this discussion, it’s all I can come up with and damn it I have to be right. I’m telling you this story exactly how I want it to be known so deal with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ-1024x589.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="Need some new champers? For $4, you can have three sets of teeth! Hell to the mother loving yeah! http://ebay.com" /></a></p>

<p>Coyote teeth make great party gifts and door prizes. The cost to enter said door in the first place however is a twisted sense of humor and the willingness to embrace whatever is on the other side. For parties that involve coyote teeth, I doubt there’ll be anything warm and welcoming. It’s probably one of the minor circles of hell, actually. But if you’re into that sort of thing…</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw-1024x588.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="1*siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw" /></a></p>

<p>You might as well take it all the way. Whatever floats your boat and rids you of that burning sensation in your pocket… which if you’re buying the above, I doubt it was money that’s been burning you all this time. I fear that you’re not meant to be holding a cross… I think you’re alergic to it.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-how-did-confusion">What the… How Did… [confusion]?</h3>
<p>I put up a question on Facebook Friday evening asking for a topic to write about. I didn’t give requirements, boundaries, or suggestions. I just ended the sentence and waited. My call was answered. Combined with Medium’s writing prompt about something related to $10 and my question on Facebook, this sounds like a great way to kill a few hours on a Saturday evening! There’s nothing like sparking the creative spirit with a completely random topic with a random modifier. I have zero interest in taxidermy but it’s quite interesting to see what kind of… eh… stuff people put up for sale. In the case of taxidermy, it’s interesting, bothersome, disturbing, and plain gross sometimes. There are loads of things I can’t unsee and will likely give me nightmares. Oh well. The cost of doing business, I guess.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this article, don’t hesitate to read the rest of my stuff here on  <a href="https://medium.com/@jlyman">Medium</a>, follow me on  <a href="https://twitter.com/theejl">Twitter</a>,  <a href="https://facebook.com/johnathan.lyman">Facebook</a>, or  <a href="https://instagram.com/jlymanphoto">Instagram</a>. I promise I’m not posting (that much) about dead animals (outside the context of this awful topic). See you around!</p>

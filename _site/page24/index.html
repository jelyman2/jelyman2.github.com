    <p>I’m a fan of getting as much as you can for free without breaking the rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every cloud storage provider has a variety of changing promos that can give you extra storage space, so it’s always worthwhile to keep an ear to the ground. Some of the promotions we mention here may change over time, but they’ll also likely be replaced by something else. Cloud storage providers seem to like giving away space like candy if it means new customers.Check out the <a href="http://drippler.com/drip/how-maximize-your-free-storage-space-every-cloud-service">full article, here</a>! I can speak to the Dropbox bonuses, personally. I have 10GB and didn’t spend a dime to get it.</p>

    <p>If only there was something like this when I was getting out of high school.</p>

<p>Introducing <a href="https://www.makeschool.com">Make School</a>:</p>

        Getting Started with Loggly
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-03-14T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">14 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>I love logs. I love massive amounts of data. I have this thing where if I feel I can consume and process tons of data by doing something menial and useless, I’ll do it. </p>

<p>One thing I don’t really do though is keep tabs on the logs for my site and its services. This is where <a href="http://loggly.com">Loggly</a> comes in, and this is my experience getting it set up.</p>

<p>Signing up was pretty easy. I just went to <a href="http://loggly.com">loggly.com,</a> clicked Sign Up in the top right corner, filled out a few things, and waited patiently while their systems used magic fairy dust and unicorn blood to construct my logging instance. They provide a full 30-day trial that gives a user full access to all features to determine if it’s really right for them. After 30 days, it drops down to their limited free tier, which is still good for small people like me.</p>

<p>I’m writing this as I go through their service, so let’s take a moment to talk about what Loggly actually does.</p>

<p>The whole goal of Loggly is to provide centralized log management without the need for agents. This allows sysadmins or anybody who cares to view and track log data in real time. You can search through logs as they come in and graph out instances of particular events to track down issues as they’re happening.</p>

<p>Logy allows you to track logs from almost any source. Their list is pretty exhaustive if you ask me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows</li>
  <li>Linux</li>
  <li>Apache</li>
  <li>Nginx</li>
  <li>IIS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Tomcat</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
  <li>Rails</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Django</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Node.JS</li>
  <li>.NET</li>
  <li>Docket</li>
  <li>Puppet</li>
  <li>Chef</li>
  <li>FluentD</li>
  <li>AWS Cloudtrail</li>
  <li>AWS S3</li>
  <li>and Heroku
That really is a pretty big list.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mentioned that you can get started for free than that there’s a free tier, but let’s talk about what that actually means and the other options that are available.</p>

<p>The free tier gives you the basics including searching and filters, persistent workspaces, and built-in alerting. The standard tier ($49/month) gives you 1GB/day of log storage and 7-day retention, unlimited users, built-in alerting, customized dashboards, and more.</p>

<p>Moving to the Pro tier is where you start getting some of the more tasty features.  You get peak overage protection, AWS S3 archiving, telephone support, and more. The default plan grants 15 days of retention at $109/month, but if you need more than that, you’re more than welcome to it: 10GB/day for $499, 50GB/day for $2500 and more. If 50GB/day and $2500 sounds like a lot, don’t worry, it is. 50GB of log files in a day though is a lot and if you need that kind of support, you’re not too worried about the price. </p>

<p>The second half of this post is to follow after my account is set up… see you soon!</p>

        Getting Started with Loggly Part 2: The Cool Stuff!

    <time datetime="2015-03-14T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">14 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>This is a continuation of part 1: <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/loggly-start">Getting Started with Loggly</a>.</p>

<p>Note: Apparently waiting hours for account generation isn’t a thing according to the fine folks on twitter @loggly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now that we’re signed up, let’s get down to the good stuff!</p>

<p>The first thing I want to do is start tracking Linux. The <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/stack">core of my site</a> is Ubuntu (among other things). Loggly makes this easy. All I need to do is click the Linux icon on my account’s main page.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1419.52.30.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>It really is as simple as copying the two lines of code and running them with superuser access. Within a few seconds, Loggly grabbed a hold and started showing me cool stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.05.00.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s pretty empty now, because I literally just started tracking and I’m only tracking Linux. With time this will become more populated and more interesting to parse through.</p>

<p>Moving on to other applications, now. I want to start tracking nginx. Nginx is just one of the apps Loggly can track. The list is massive.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.06.39.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Getting Nginx set up was just as easy as Linux, although Loggly believed my Nginx logs weren’t of a proper format. No matter, they’re coming in great.</p>

<p>Getting MySQL set up isn’t a one-click process like the others. This requires MySQL to do some extra work and get a bit re-configured. No worries, it’s nothing extravagant.</p>

<p>Setting up PHP was a breeze, and I like a good breeze.</p>

<p>Once everything was added like I wanted, I started poking through my logs to see if I could really find good data without hassle. Turns out, I can.</p>

<p>What’s better than watching someone from China try to hack into your system via SSH by trying to log in as the root user?</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.25.24.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Nothing <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>I’d recommend Loggly to anyone who wants to consolidate and be able to parse and search through their log data. You might not need the heavy plans, I know I don’t. It’s still good to be able to look at events as they happen in real time with an interface that doesn’t suck and from anywhere in the world without having to log into your system.</p>

<p>Go check out <a href="http://loggly.com">Loggly</a>, right now. You’ll enjoy it, for sure!</p>

    <p>I use <a href="https://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>. It keeps track of all sorts of goodies for me. The thing I like the most and really appreciate is the visitor tracking. I like knowing how many people visit my site on a regular basis. I don’t use much outside those base features, though. Good thing there’s an app for that.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/logo_black.png?resize=301%2C89" alt="" />There’s a sick little iPhone and OS X app called <a href="http://gagetapp.com">GAget</a>. It’s sole purpose is to provide you with just-the-meat of your <a href="https://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> data including visitor sessions, bounce rate, new visitor percentage, and visit length. On iOS, this comes in the form of a super clean app that you can scroll though. On OS X, it’s a notification center widget. Both are super sexy.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend you check it out on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget-simple-widget-for-google/id968487158?mt=12">OS X App Store</a> ($2.99) or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget/id716442061">iOS App Store</a> ($1.99).</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-24T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">24 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>A rather odd thing started happening shortly after I implemented Jetpack on this site. I was seeing my posts show up on twitter, which is nice and all, but not through the method I had set up. I describe how I set up automatic post scheduling for the various social networks in this past. These tweets were being written without a fancy permalink, which seemed odd and told me that it wasn’t something of my intentional doing. After doing some research, I discovered someone having an issue with the Publicize plugin not removing a social media account properly. In order to fix their issue, they re-added their account and removed it again.</p>

<p>I figured it would be a stretch but I knew it couldn’t hurt anything so I tried that myself just to see what would happen. I Added my Facebook page, and after authorization, lo and behold, my twitter account showed up, too. It wasn’t previously authorized so I had a pretty good idea this ghost authorization was what was causing these unwanted shares. Un-linking my twitter account immediately solved the problem, and I was on my way to sharing the way I want to: WordPress &gt; IFTTT &gt; Buffer.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-24T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">24 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>Let’s be honest. The year is 2015 and nobody wants to do things by hand or manually if they can help it. Companies are hiring people to automate the hell out of everything because like M.I.A (sort of, not really) <a href="http://go.jlyman.net/1JnTw3K">famously rapped</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>live fast, die young, robots do it well.</em>“I’ll admit, I like speeding up the process of sharing what I’ve written but I like controlling it a bit more than some. Here’s how I do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll want to create an account with <a href="http://go.jlyman.net/1Cpvd3e" title="IFTTT">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a> if you haven’t already. IFTTT stands for <strong>IF</strong>  <strong>T</strong> his, <strong>T</strong> hen <strong>T</strong> hat. The premise is that you can take data being expelled from one service, and based on certain criteria, do something with it via another. Things like “Text me with the daily weather report at 5AM” are easy and, well, kind of cheesy. If you become a power user of IFT.TT or already are, you’ll know that there’s so much more you can do with the service like auto-tweet breaking news stories from news sources or trigger your Philips Hue home lighting to change color when a storm warning comes into effect.</p>

<p>In my case, I want to sync IFTTT with my WordPress install. To start, I’ll need to create a new recipe and click on the blue <em>this</em> link (A) and choose the WordPress trigger channel (B). This will be the source for the data that IFTT uses.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt_step1.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt_step1-1024x640.jpg?resize=629%2C393" alt="ifttt_step1" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once I have that set, I can choose whether I want this action to be triggered by any new post from WordPress, or just when the post has a particular tag or category. In my case, I choose the former, because I want to share all posts.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.48.33.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.48.33.png?resize=629%2C243" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.48.33" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>We can skip Step 3 as there’s nothing else to set for these triggers and move on to step four. Click Create Trigger.</p>

<p>So at this point we’ve established that if there’s any new post on WordPress Blog then we’ll do something. Now we establish what that something is. Click the blue _that _link. In my case, I want to share to Buffer.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.36.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.29.png?resize=627%2C199" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.51.29" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.36.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.36.png?resize=627%2C262" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.51.36" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I will want to choose the “Add to Buffer” option since I won’t be pushing photos from my source. My final step is to set up how I want my shares to look and then I create my action.</p>

<p><em>Note: If this is your first time, you’ll have to set up what account you want Buffer to schedule this IFTTT-pushed content on. </em></p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.53.36.png"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.53.36.png?resize=627%2C308" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.53.36" /></a></p>

<p>There are a couple things to keep in mind when setting this up. Anything pushed from IFTTT to Buffer: 1) will be set to whatever schedules you have created and 2), will only be pushed to whatever social media account you have set up for this channel. You can only have one social media account chosen for this type of setup.</p>

<p>If you want to use more than just one social media account to share you content, I recommend creating separate recipes for each. Granted, only one of them will be scheduled via Buffer, so keep that in mind. In my situation, I don’t really mind, and I use Buffer so much already that I like having the ability to manually schedule for other social media accounts that don’t get as much regular pushing of content.</p>

<h3 id="all-done">All Done!</h3>
<p>It’s that simple. If you have account with IFTTT and Buffer already set up, this will take you thirty seconds to do. You’ll find this thirty seconds will save you time in the long run and will become something that you don’t even think about at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Sure you could use WordPress plugins, too, and that’s all fine and dandy. I’m not stopping you! This is how I like to do it and I figured someone out there might like to know.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by, have a good one!</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page24/" rel="bookmark" title="Looking Ahead to February">Looking Ahead to February</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-01-24T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">24 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>I missed writing yesterday, for the first time in almost three weeks but I had good reason. I was testing out an alarm clock app on my iPhone that plays gentle sounds that are supposed to gradually wake you. I thought this would be a great idea as I’m all about waking up to something less than an apocalypse coming from a bedside table. I promise this is going somewhere and is related to what I eventually want to talk about.</p>

<p>The first night I tried this app, it didn’t work. Turns out, it’s useless when you blatantly lock the phone. The notifications it throws are also useless in alerting you that it’s time to wake if you use the night-time privacy setting, like I do. After the first morning, all I got were a bunch of notifications that meant nothing to me anymore and was instead awoken by my wife, who just happened to be awake at the time.</p>

<p>The second night, I did a bit of poking around and found out that an app cannot play sounds while the phone is locked without user intervention. This is why I can play music and sounds all day so long as I tap a play button but an alarm clock app cannot automatically start making music. The workaround for my new alarm clock app friend is to leave the screen open, don’t let it lock, and just darken it after X minutes passes. That’s all find and dandy. The first few minutes the screen was on didn’t bother me as the screen was technically pretty dark to begin with; the UI elements weren’t bright at all, likely by design for night usage.</p>

<p>Come morning, however, this is where I realized I need a bit more push than gentle sounds to wake me up. I set my alarm for 3:30am to start making noise and work its way through sounds that get louder and more abrasive. Turns out, that did very little. It took two hours for me to notice my alarm was going off, a.k.a. 5:30am. Most days, I would be walking out the door at that point. With a small change of plans, I started rushing through my morning and I started remembering exactly why I get up earlier. Having the extra time to spin up every morning is much nicer and feels much better than getting more sleep. I’d trade an hour and a half of sleep for an hour and a half of time I can be productive, any day, so long as it’s in the morning. I’m not so much a fan of staying up late at night because by around 8pm, I’m pretty tired and staying up later doesn’t yield much productivity.</p>

<p>So anyway, back to my original topic of discussion. Because I missed my alarm, that was apparently going off for two hours like it was no big deal, I missed a writing session. I would have been writing from 4:15 to 5:15 or so and my creative juices would have been flowing. I told myself it was going to be all right and I was still meeting <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart" title="Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year">my goals for writing</a> something substantial at least twice a week. However, it got me thinking about expanding that idea and having two substantial posts and a few more minor posts talking about smaller topics. Here’s where we get into plans for February.</p>

<p>To say I don’t write enough isn’t quite accurate. I think at this point in time, based on recent history—three weeks—I’m writing plenty, that’s not the modification to my goal. What I want to start enforcing with myself is that I write every day of the week, no matter what and no matter how short or long the posts are, so long as I have two substantial posts per week. This plays on my old goals and gives me something to fill in for the remaining days of the week. I was thinking to myself just this morning that I could skip writing today because I’m still meeting my goals, but I really don’t want to skip writing. I enjoy writing. I enjoy telling a story about something that happened to me. I like sharing an experience. I like giving a tutorial or sharing instructions.</p>

<p>So be it. Every day, I’m writing more. March, I’ll up the ante, again in a small way—so as to not over-burden myself and end up quitting—and so on. Starting with February, I’m sticking to a daily writing routine with two days of substantial content and five days of shorter topics, minimum. I won’t stop myself from putting down three thousand words on a subject if I feel like it, I just won’t require it (yet).</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-24T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">24 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>I hope the title drew you in a bit because unfortunately I’m not talking about anything super juicy. I do a lot of different things here and there that relate to my career in the IT field as well as activities that have zero to do with it. I’ll admit, I enjoy my job and the new challenges it brings, but sometimes, at the end of the day, I just want to see someone else play video games. Other days, I want to keep my options open <a href="http://jlymanphotography.net">go photograph a sunset</a>. That doesn’t make me a bad person, it just makes me easy to distract. Fortunately, I don’t have that problem with my personal relationships, or I’m sure my wife would kill me. Moving on…</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that I don’t have a huge list of hobbies for good reason. If I did, I wouldn’t ever finish any of them. I have a few things I really enjoy and I tend to stick with them. These things include photography, writing, web design, and gaming. I’m going to break these down into their own parts and describe what about them is important to me and why, at times, it takes precedence over everything else. </p>

<h2 id="photography">﻿Photography</h2>
<p>As a hobby, I believe it to be the most serious one, as it is the one I have sunk the most money into. I have yet to turn a profit, and part of that is intentional. I really enjoy making photographs, but I do not have the time to make it a full-time job, yet. Perhaps someday in the future, I will be able to live off of print sales, but the odds are not in my favor and I would rather not bet against the house on that one.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I kept telling myself I would spend more time making photographs than I did the year prior. While that statement has mostly been hot air, there has been some truth to it. I have created more quality photos in 2014 than I did in 2013, and 2015 is already starting off on the right foot, with more quality photos made than in the same month a year prior. I believe the trend will continue, so long as I do not find myself getting caught up in everything else, which might happen.</p>

<p>I put photography first on my list because it is the hobby I see myself sticking with the longest. It allows me to get out and adventure more than anything else I do, mainly because everything else I do is a largely stationary activity. One does not frag noobs in the forest. The biggest hurdle and detractor from making this hobby an even more serious part of my life is motivation. In 2014, I visited places I had never seen before, and likely would have never visited. It gave me an excuse to up to the mountains and stand around looking at nature. I don’t know many people who willy-nilly drive almost three hours each way to stand around. I’m sure most people would extrapolate that a bit and call it hiking; I’m not much of a hiker if I don’t have my camera. </p>

<p>In 2015, big life changes are coming my way and that has and will continue to be my motivation to get out more and shoot while I still can. My wife and I won’t likely be coming back to the Seattle area for at least five years, maybe six or seven. That’s a long time to be away from great locations to shoot.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>With writing, I don’t have a problem actually doing it. I really enjoy it. In fact, this particular post is my fourth for the day. It’s a great way to kill time and stimulate my mind simultaneously. It’s better than playing video games and watching TV. It’s not as stimulating as photography, however, but it’s not very warm outside right now. If we were currently in the summer season, I might be sitting outside or at least with the window open, getting some natural air and light exposure. Right now, it’s dark and bleh.</p>

<p>My largest hurdle with writing is motivation, just like photography. It’s easy to say that I’ll do it later or I’d rather play video games because I’m tired of typing. In reality, typing is just a thing, like breathing, that happens when I write. I can type for hours if I have something to type. ﻿Once I get the spark that ignites my internal writing engine, I can hammer out a college paper in a few hours or a story on cheap taxidermy in no time at all, without even thinking about it. My mind just flows and whatever is up next gets put onto the digital paper.</p>

<p>My lack of commitment to writing is already actively being addressed via several angles. First, I formally started up this blog by taking the Ten Days to a Better Blog challenge (also referred to as #10DaysBetterBlog). It was a simple challenge/workshop that involved writing for ten days straight and in the meantime, working out the kinks that prevent you from being able to write consistently and making realistic goals for yourself to build up your writing lifestyle. It didn’t have anything to do with writing styles, topics, or anything of the sort. Search Engine Optimization wasn’t a part of it, either. The idea was solely that no matter what, you should never not write. Writing is a great way to voice opinions, ideas, thoughts, and help others. Even if the topics are seemingly random, it still helps in two ways by helping you learn to write more and get used to the idea of putting your ideas and thoughts on digital (or even regular) paper and the possibility that someone might stumble upon something you wrote at one time and it ends up helping them with whatever issue they were having that may or may not have been related to what you were talking about.</p>

<p>One I stated getting into the workshop, I started changing my morning routine, too. I now wake up 90 minutes earlier every day so I can take time and write. It gets me going in the morning and gets me thinking about something worthwhile. I find that self-discovery and reflection is a great thing to do in the morning. Plus, I’ve gotten used to sleeping a more consistent schedule so I’m not always so groggy in the morning. Before I hacked my morning routine, I felt rushed and grumpy every morning as I was heading into work. I didn’t feel useful or productive until well into mid-morning, and it was starting to piss me off. I really can thank the #10DaysBetterBlog challenge/workshop for the assist in getting my morning crap worked out. </p>

<h2 id="web-design">Web Design</h2>
<p>I like working with the Web. To say I’m a designer isn’t really true in the strict sense of it, but I think it still technically fits. I’m always working on a new way to display my site and am constantly tweaking it. Would something like that land me a job doing it full time? Probably not. Typically companies are looking for more than just someone who likes tweaking with their web server settings every now and then after discovering some crazy new tool or script that does this one thing that no one will ever know about and may not actually be useful in any way.</p>

<p>I took the time on purpose to build up this site from scratch. I built the server, installed the proper software, configured it, installed and configured WordPress, and more, all on my own, all intentionally. It’s stuff I like to do. I’m sure there are a lot of different ways to go about doing what I just described and there are many different series that do that for you because frankly some people just don’t have the time to tweak and screw with stuff to get it to work. If I felt that way, I’d be all over those services, too. ﻿I like to think that learning more about how the inner workings of a web server actually function would help me in my career. I don’t do it just for giggles. </p>

<p>One thing I want to work on for 2015 is taking the time to deep dive into a particular technology and understand it fully. For example, I know what Memcached is, and I could get it running with reference material, but that’s it. If I wanted to excel in that tech, I’d need to know it inside and out and really understand how it works and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Same goes for a lot of services tech companies use these days like NodeJS, Cassandra, Hadoop, etc. </p>

<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
<p>I’ve always had this idea in the back of my head that one day I’ll be able to play video games professionally. I see people on YouTube who do it and do it well and they make loads of cash. Granted they’ve spent a vast amount of time getting to where they are now. I don’t know if I’d ever be able to make it that far with everything else I have going on and with the fact that at times, I’ll go a few months without playing more than a couple hours worth of video games. At my current pace, I’ll become a pro gamer in the year 2150. Good thing I bought a Turtle Beach Major League Gaming-branded headset to shout into when I’m playing Destiny and smoking fools. ﻿</p>

<p>I don’t have any desire to change the level of commitment I have to this hobby. It’s a great distraction when I don’t want to think about much and would rather veg and checkout from reality for a bit. I can totally understand why some people play games non stop. There’s a whole different world in each game that doesn’t involve anything remotely like being yourself. You really could be anybody and that’s kind of creepy but cool at the same time. </p>

<h2 id="at-the-end-of-the-day">At the End of the Day…</h2>
<p>I’m not that bad. I’m sorry I don’t spend enough time with you. I understand your needs are important but to be honest, my needs are, too. Sometimes they change a bit. Don’t think I forget about you, though. I never forget, which is why I keep coming back. Just don’t expect me to constantly pay attention to you. ﻿I enjoy keeping it fresh. We’ll go on that hike soon and I’m sure we’ll have some great views and come back with some awesome memories. Likewise, I’m sure I’ll get around to that book I’ve always been meaning to write with you.Don’t forget I bought you that pass so we could spend more time together making fools out of our enemies. I got that because I knew we could enjoy it together, I just wasn’t expecting you to want that all the time. </p>

    <p>This one will be short, today. My wife and I are seeing changes blowing in the wind and the storm is certainly on its way. We’re moving to the great, sunny, state of California, more specifically, to the Bay Area. We’re excited and scared at the same time. From my point of view, my career will be taking a left turn into something greater, for sure, but that means more pressure to perform from me. On the flip side, I can also better my skills as a photographer, there, too, with all sorts of new locations and opportunities to grow.</p>

<p>It’s a difficult thing to pick up and move roughly a thousand miles away from where you grew up, but I know it’s worth it. The worst thing either of us could do is be too scared to act. I’d hate to see a potential opportunity for success be thrown away because we didn’t take the leap. Starting a new chapter in our lives is great. Starting it somewhere new for both of us is even better.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-21T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>Sometimes I wonder about cats. Who invented them? Why are they here? Are those whiskers really just antennae they use to communicate with their alien space ships? All these things are valid questions if you are like me, because obviously my brain isn’t stimulated enough as it is. Of all cat-related questions out there, the one that keeps me the most interested and stumped is: what’s with the boxlust?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s a word I just came up with. Boxlust. Noun. The unreasonable and indescribable urge to be in, on, or around boxes as much as possible, for particular reason. I’ve witnessed my cat enjoy cardboard boxes like none other. Even as a kid, I enjoyed boxes, but not to the extent my feline friend does.</p>

<p>So that got me wondering: perhaps someone’s looked into this already! I look to the ever trusting Internet to find out the who, what, where, why, and how of cats and their desires for cardboard containers with eight right-angled corners.</p>

<p>The first thing I came up with was a quote from Stephen Zawistowski from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals (ASPCA). <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-do-cats-like-boxes-2013-6">He said</a> “Cats like boxes because they are cryptic animals; they like to hide…[it] gives them a place of safety and security.” That explains a lot. When my cat enters his corrugated fortress, I’ll find he’s dug a mote around his encampment and at some point in the day found alligators to fill it. I’m still trying to figure out where he was able to procure alligators, as I can’t even seem to procure the right kind of accessories for my Playstation 4 on Amazon.</p>

<p>Live Science <a href="http://www.livescience.com/45461-why-do-cats-like-boxes.html">tells us</a> that seeking out confined spaces is an instinctual behavior for cats. That makes sense, just like it’s an instinctual behavior for me to seek out a couch to veg on all weekend, every weekend. It’s a fire that burns deep in my core, and I suspect my cat lusts after the four-walled brown structure of an Amazon.com shipping box like a heroin addict lusts after crank: with the burning intensity of a thousand suns.</p>

<p>Although this all sounds like good information, I wasn’t satisfied with such normal and structured answers, so I took to reddit because why not? if the Internet has something to say about something, they’ll be saying it on reddit. Reddit User <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2fjma4/eli5_why_do_cats_like_boxes/ck9x5j7">OookOok says</a> it has something to do with trees, wood pulp, and the similarity. I’m trying to think of what wild cat fits <em>inside</em> a tree and can’t seem to come up with anything. Oh well, perhaps I’m missing a crucial demographic of the wild cat species: the one that’s like my house cat but somehow feral or wild? I didn’t know that was such a thing.</p>

<p>But then I got to thinking: in my obviously non-scientific accidental experiments, our cat seems to enjoy sitting on paper more than anything else. If my cat knew how to pay the child came “Hot Lava,” he’s a freaking expert. I feel like if my carpet ever became poisonous, he’d survive longer than I would. Perhaps he’s giving his <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2fjma4/eli5_why_do_cats_like_boxes/cka5hvk">kitty stamp of approval</a>?</p>

<p>Whatever the reason is, I find it incredibly amusing. I’ve given up on buying cat trees, beds, houses, or other expensive toys. He’s resorted to several $1 rattling mice, pens, and paper products. I really should see if Staples is selling cat toys now. I feel like they’d have a great new product line and niche covered in a heartbeat. Either that or just get him a job with UPS. All those boxes? Yeah, he’d dig that.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-20T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">20 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>When I’m not working, writing, or studying, I’m (ideally) shooting. I’m a <a href="http://jlymanphotography.net">landscape photographer</a> and by shooting I mean “taking photos of.” One of the things I struggled with in 2014 was my motivation to shoot more. I’ve always had a small inkling in the back of my mind that I’d like to live out a career at my desk writing and taking photos. With my start to writing underway (and so far going relatively smoothly), the next half of that is creating more photos.</p>

<p>A lot of photographers will tell you that the gear doesn’t make the photographer. While I find that to be true, the gear does make the photographer more motivated if the gear they just bought is exponentially better than what they used to own. See, up until the end of last year, I owned a four year old camera body—the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_60d">Canon 60D</a>—and a couple of lenses. Unfortunately, the 60D wasn’t the best for landscape photography for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor">Crop-Sensor</a>: While create for getting extra range when using a telephoto lens, the smaller sensor leads to more noise on the image because each individual pixel is much smaller. This became unbearable at a larger print sizes, which I love doing. I have a 30×20” photo in my dining room I took at Mt. Rainier that I would love to re-shoot with my new equipment. I know I’d get much better results.</p>

<p>2) Lens Selection: While I could pick out awesome, expensive glass, it wouldn’t be worth it. With a crop sensor body, I’d have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor">multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6</a>, which takes an amazing landscape photography lens such as the Canon 16-35mm and turns it into a 25.6-56mm lens. While that sounds nice, that’s a bit too narrow for me. So I settled with a 3rd-party brand lens that gave me 10-20mm of range, which equated to 16-36mm, exactly where I wanted, but with a trade-off. It wasn’t super sharp.</p>

<p>With those two elements combined, I had a setup that I didn’t really appreciate so I stopped using it a lot. When I had the opportunity to replace my gear, I jumped on the idea, and ordered a new body—the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_6d">Canon 6D</a>—and the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_16_35mm_f_4l_is_usm">Canon 16-35mm F/4 lens</a>. For what I want to shoot, it’s an amazing combination and so far I’ve had nothing but awesome luck and experiences with the combination. The setup is light and agile but not flimsy. The field of view is spectacular and the quality of imagery on the sharpness and clarity fronts are epic. Well worth the purchase.</p>

<p>For those who say that new gear won’t help you take better photos, they might be wrong if the old gear was of retiring age.</p>

<p>When it comes to actually taking photos, however, there’s no amount of gear that will make me get out and shoot. I have to want to. With the gear half of my desire out of the way, all I have left is myself to fight with. For 2015, I’m attempting to apply the <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart" title="Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year">same goals I set up for my writing</a> to my photography and have broken them down as such:</p>

<p>1) Shoot at least twice a week</p>

<p>2) Different locations each time, not coming back for at least a month</p>

<p>3) Share at least one image from each shoot.</p>

<p>4) Stay at the location for as long as I deem necessary so as to not feel rushed.</p>

<p>5) Start taking my camera more places, intentionally, in case an opportunity appears.</p>

<p>These are rougher goals and guidelines than what I established for my wordsmith self, and that’s ok. I have a running list of places I want to shoot and each location requires different coordination in terms of time of day, weather, how long I’m there, how long it takes to get to my final destination, etc. I can’t reasonably expect it to take an hour to shoot at a beach at sunset and take the same amount of time while I hike two miles each way to a waterfall while raining. That’s unrealistic.</p>

<p>I think a lot of my shooting will end up on the weekends, as during the week, I am working a day job so my possible options will typically be limited to sunsets and night-time photography such as shooting the stars. I’m all right with that. I shoot over the weekend while I was in California and got some great photos. After work yesterday, I ran out and shot a sunset at the beach and got more great photos. I could have just as easily stayed home after work because I was certainly tired, but I knew that it wouldn’t take <em>that</em> long, and I really just need to do it and stop complaining.</p>

<p>If I ever want to make this something I do more regularly and possibly make money from, I need to work at it more. Same with writing. If I ever want to make something of it, I need to keep at it. No one becomes famous overnight (unless you go viral on the Internet, but even then that’s not really fame).</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-19T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">19 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>We all remember our first smartphones, for the most part. I know I remember my transition from the small brick phones that weighed as much as small bricks. They did the job back then. In 2003, texting was a limited thing still in my world and around all of my friends. We mostly emailed and instant-messaged each other. I think I did that pretty much all through high school. When I started using MySpace regularly, I communicated a lot through that service with my friends. Facebook, same story. It wasn’t until I bought my first smart phone in 2010 that my communication world really changed.</p>

<p>When I got my first flip phone, it was in 2007. I signed up with Verizon Wireless and felt super accomplished. I also had just turned 18 so I was allowed to sign up for stuff all by myself! I felt so accomplished. I even still remember my phone number from that time! I thoguht my phone was the coolest thing in the world. It had music playback capability, a front screen with music controls on it, I could browse the Internet with the built-in WAP browser… that was the life, for sure. Back then, battery life was awesome, too. I could go a couple days without charge while still using it regularly. I made a habit of plugging in nightly, though, as charging cables were still proprietary and good quality connectors were hard to come by.</p>

<p>My first flip phone was the LG Chocolate III. It was bigger than most flip phones of the time, and I loved that. It was shiny, had a great looking screen( for a flip phone) and the interface made it feel expensive. Since this was my first phone that had more than one color on the screen, I didn’t care about things like interface speed, lag, ux, or anything of the sort. It’s likely that a lot of people felt the same way. I rocked this phone for until my next upgrade date, which came 20 months later.</p>

<p>After I got my first taste of what adulthood brought in terms of mobile telephony, I wanted to kick it up a notch. The iPhone was still a really new thing and the iPhone 3G was out, but was an AT&amp;T exclusive. I didn’t want to switch nor did I have the money to shell out for a true smartphone (yet). I bought the LG Dare. With its 240x400px screen, I felt like I was living the high life. Bluetooth, HTML Web browsing, MP3 and AAC support… ahh the features! The Dare (VX9700) was my first entry into touch-screen space and I loved it.</p>

<p>Comparing the size to my current iPhone 5, the Dare was shorter (4.87 vs 4.1 inches), slightly narrower (2.31 vs 2.2 inches), and thicker (0.3 vs 0.5 inches). It’s amazing to think about how far display technology has come where you have a deivce like the Dare with 0.08mp of screen resolution at 152ppi over a three inch screen versus the iPhone 5’s 0.72mp screen at 326ppi over four inches. Talk about a jump in resolution!</p>

<p>When 2010 came, I finally landed my first real smart phone. By this time, the iPhone was still an AT&amp;T exclusive and I didn’t want to pay more money for the same measured service. I didn’t care about what one carrier had over the other. All I cared about was the fact that I would have to shell out more dollars for the same offering; that didn’t sound like a good investment, to me.</p>

<p>Instead of landing the iPhone, which wasn’t all bad as I wasn’t a fan of Apple products beyond the black iPod Nano I had at the time, I picked up the Motorola Droid X. When it arrived via FedEx, I was beyond excited. This was my first phone I could do complicated stuff with. It had a <em>real</em> browser, not some wimpy WAP-based turd. It had apps, too! The concept of Apps blew my mind and my views on my mobile device would never be the same. It had a huge—for its time—4.3” touch screen. With a 480×854 resolution, it was at the top of the smart phone display game, second to the iPhone, of course, which still had a higher density resolution screen.</p>

<p>At the time, though, I had no idea what that meant or why that would be significant to anybody. I was glad I had a device that was fast and had a big, beautiful display.</p>

<p>After about a year, though, I grew tired of this device. It made me feel that way, though, because at the time, Android aged quickly and updates to the software didn’t happen quick enough, if at all. The highest version one could install via traditional means was Gingerbread (2.3). It became clunky and slow and reminded me daily that it enjoyed gulping up battery juice. Even with larger capacity batteries, it didn’t take long before I got rid of it and switch to an iPhone.</p>

<p>After my battle with Android, I promised myself I wouldn’t buy another Android device, again. For the most part, I held fast to that promise. After I gave up my Droid X, my first <em>real</em> smart phone, I bought an iPhone 4S. I was thrilled to give it a shot after I heard so many good things about it from co-workers. I’ll admit it was a bit of a shock when I changed ecosystems. The whole premise was much different and I would grow to learn that was a good thing. This was my first realization that there are some devices I just want to work, no matter what. I don’t want to have to or even think about tinkering with some things, and my phone was the first on that list. It’s this idea that would eventually push me to replace my Windows PC that I hand built with a Mac.</p>

<p>Aside: to this day, I still get comments like “I’d never spend 2x on a closed platform” or “way to spend much more than any of that hardware is worth!” I like to casually remind people that unlike their Windows desktop or laptop, you’ll never hear me complaining about my mac being slow or crashing. To this day I’ve only hard rebooted my mac a couple times. As of this writing, I’ve never re-installed the OS, nor have I had to have it serviced for failing parts that don’t have a definite lifespan.</p>

<p>In 2013, I thought I’d give the Galaxy S4 a try, as I liked the idea of the large, bright, and colorful screen. Maybe that was my downfall, just as certain insects attract their prey with bright and beautfiful colors and or the allure of something great (read: black widow) only to kill them in the end because they made a stupid decision. The Galaxy S4 started killing me shortly after I got it. I was reminded of all the reasons why I disliked android: battery life, poor resource management, too many things that need tinkering to work right. I dumped it after just a few months and went back to an iPhone, where I sit to this day.</p>

<p>My next phone certainly won’t be an Android device. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? Nah. Perhaps I’ll pick up an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6S (or whatever the next version is that comes out this fall). All I know is that I bought android as my first smart phone because that was what I had available to me at the time. If I had been an AT&amp;T customer from the start, I may have never purchased an Android smartphone and had an iPhone from the beginning. If that was the case, I might have bought an Android device later on down the road anyway, and fought through the same battles, just in a different time frame. I can’t say for sure what would have happened, but I know that my first smart phone purchase helped shape my technology toolset as it stands now and my continued purchases will help mold my future decisions. Apple has done a good job of building up an ecosystem people don’t want to leave, and I’ll admit I am one of them. It’s comforting to know, however, that there are a lot of people like me who just want their stuff to work. If that means paying more, then so be it. Consider it a no-hassle tax.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">14 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>So this is it. I signed on to the #10DaysBetterBlog challenge thinking I need to kick myself in the butt when it came to writing. I knew I wanted to do it, but I lacked motivation. I needed something that I could stick to, and work on in little pieces. Just telling myself “write more, ya dummy!” wasn’t cutting it. John Saddington’s 10 Days to a Better Blog has been the motivation I needed. I like to think of it as a personal workout regimen put together by a trainer. People <em>want</em> to get back into shape, but they having something there to motivate them and give them a place to start helps greatly. This was my personal training for writting.</p>

<p>But not just the action of putting words onto digital paper was affected, though. I re-started my blog. I decided to give a crap about sharing my ideas online. Sure I’ve written a couple things in the past. Back then, I kept telling myself that nobody wanted to read it so why bother? Over the last couple weeks, I learned something about that idea: it doesn’t matter how many people read it, it’s just the fact that you do it. I maybe have gotten three hundred unique sets of eyes over the last two weeks because of this challenge, and my posting links on the Desk.pm Community site. When it’s all over, I might not see any of those people again. Eleven days ago, things woudld have been different but now, I don’t care. I mean… I do care. I want to see people come to my site and read what I have to say. What I mean is that if I only get one set of eyes and those eyes belong to my wife or my mom or someone who reads my stuff in support of me, then that’s good enough. The number of eyes doesn’t effect my desire to write, anymore, and ideally it never will, again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I rambled a bit about where I want to go with my blogging, and set goals for myself a couple days ago. Looking back on the fact that I was able to write something and post it every day for ten days in a row is awesome. Taking the new found knoweldge I have on how much time it really doesn’t take to write something worthwhile and combining it with relfections of my goals and what I want to write about, the idea of keeping the train moving swiftly isn’t daunting. As I look back, I can say that two weeks ago me would have disagreed. I would have sighed at the idea of having to sit down and write every day, thinking that I’ll end up spending hours on something and have zero return. Nah. I get a boatload of returns each time and I don’t have to spend all day.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Completing this challenge/workshop has also helped my regular, daily routine. I discussed how I used to have a terrible morning ritual. It really wasn’t a ritual but more of a dazed panic, kind of like what happens right after you get out of your car after getting into a wreck and are losing your mind but you checked out at the same time? That’s how I used to feel every morning. That’s a terrible way to go to work and it leads to zero productivity. It used to take a couple hours to get my brain to spin up to full speed and waiting for that to happen made me even more tired. Now, I get up earlier, thanks to hacking my sleep schedule and making myself set aside time in the morning to do something stimulating like sitting down and writing. I used to think that getting up at 3:30-4:00am when I don’t have to leave until 5:30am was a joke. That’s a good 1 1/2-2 hours of sleep I could be getting. While that is <em>technically</em> true, it was more about when I wake up in my sleep cycle. Figuring that out and waking up more graually helped a lot more than sleeping in. I know this to be true because my weekends are still a bit sketchy. I still need to work on keeping my routine consistent on the weekends so my body can get used to it quicker. No hacks happen when you reset after five days, just to start over, again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It might be too late to create a new year’s resoltion but I don’t really care. I think the last couple weeks has been a long crafting process for my delayed new year’s resolution. Here’s to writing.</p>

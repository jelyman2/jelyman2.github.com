        Finding a Short Domain Based on a Name is Harder Than Ever
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-10T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">10 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>I’ve always really enjoyed having a short address to rely upon when I tell people where to find my sites. I’m personally of the idea that the shorter you can get your address and have it still make sense, the better, especially on mobile devices. Not everyone is willing to type in myreallycoolmobileapp.com when having appname.com is much better, or even app.co, if it’s available.</p>

<p>A lot of the two-letter TLDs belong to countries and some have rules or restrictions on who can register with them. The ones that don’t have rules or restrictions typically still charge an arm and a leg. For example, we all know the URL shortener bit.ly. Would you believe me if I told you that the .ly TLD goes for $150 for the first year on <a href="http://101domains.com">101domains.com</a>? Renewals are $230 for a single year. That’s a lot. There are TLDs that are much cheaper, like .co, .io, .is, .me, and whatnot, which is great!</p>

<p>Some however aren’t…</p>

<h3 id="the-differences">The Differences</h3>
<p>There are several acronyms for the various top-level domains you see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gTLD – Generic. (.com, .net, .org, .ws)</li>
  <li>ccTLD – Country Code. (.us, .uk, .ir, .br)</li>
  <li>IDN – Internationalized (.中国 / .xn–fiqs8s)
## The Struggle is Real
My problem is, however, that when I want to register a short domain that uses my name with a short TLD, I’m limited on options, unless I’d like it to make zero sense. My first name is Johnathan, and that right there is too long for my tastes (hence why I currently use <a href="https://jlyman.net">jlyman.net</a>; 6+3 is better than 9+3). I’d like to register a john.TLD domain but all the cheap ones are taken. Not surprising though, since John is an incredibly popular name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="varying-difficultly">Varying Difficult.ly</h2>
<p>With the proliferation of the Internet and everyone having an app, service, blog or portfolio, short addresses are harder to come by and the ones that are free will cost you. In the grand scheme of things, if I were to register a .ly address (for example), $150 a year isn’t too bad, and if I went straight to the source for the .ly TLD, I could save a lot of money. Finding “the source” wasn’t as easy as some are, however. With .ly, the country is Libya. Libya isn’t necessarily known for being the number one country for technological ease of use or freedoms. However, their NIC (Network Information Center) at <a href="http://nic.ly">nic.ly</a> provides a link to another site, <a href="http://ltt.ly">ltt.ly</a> (Libya Telecom and Technology), which gives a list of approved vendors of .ly domain names. On this list, is <a href="http://LibyanSpider.com">LibyanSpider.com</a>, a Libyan hosting and domain name registrar. They say I can register a .ly domain for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=40+LYD&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#rls=en&amp;q=40+LYD+to+USD">40 LYD</a>, but since I’m an international customer, I have to use <a href="http://Register.ly">Register.ly</a>. Now four levels in, I finally find a registrar that doesn’t charge as much as 101domains. At $75, while still a serious markup (one LYD is $0.84 as I’m writing this) over the 40 LYD ($33.48 USD), it’s about as good as I’m going to get. I can’t reasonably expect to get a foreign domain name that hasn’t been completely mainstreamed by the Internet for the price of a .com or .co.</p>

<h2 id="and-its-gone">.An(d) it’s gone.</h2>
<p>There are other registrar setups like this one out there for other countries, too. Some are harder to get into, like .an, which isn’t even available anymore, since the Netherlands Antilles dissolved in 2010 and became the distinct countries of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, along with three smaller still-Dutch-owned municipalities Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-just-fantasy">.is This Just Fantasy?</h2>
<p>The TLD .is is gaining in popularity, too, but isn’t dead easy (unless you want to pay the 101domains price). Iceland owns this TLD and can be registered directly via their NIC site at <a href="http://isnic.is">isnic.is</a>. At roughly $36 USD, it’s not a bad price, but their site isn’t very intuitive. Sometimes, paying a bit more makes the whole process that much easier.</p>

<p>I could go on for days talking about all the different gTLDs out there, but I think you’d have a lot more fun looking them all up yourself. Luckily, Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">has pretty much every TLD</a> out there in one list.</p>

<h2 id="new-gtlds">New gTLDs</h2>
<p>With the launch of newer topic-based gTLDs like .photos and .club, a lot of sites will eventually transfer over and older ccTLD and gTLD domains will <em>eventually</em> expire, unless a company chooses to keep renewing it and use it as a redirect. I’ve thought about having something like john.blog or jltech.blog, but I haven’t been able to make up my mind. There are a lot more options in the word-based TLD space.</p>

<p>I think this’ll forever be an ongoing battle. People with short names will always have the one-up on me.</p>

        Reflection
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-09T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">09 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>Every once in a while it’s a good idea to just take some time and reflect. As I sit here with my morning coffee, on my way to hardening my new morning routine (which I first described <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/143/space" title="The Space in Which I Craft">here</a>), I feel like the <a href="/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a> challenge I’ve taken on has helped me to try and get into a new way of starting my morning. For example, yesterday, I tried out new music playlists on my way into work. Since I ride the bus to work, keeping my mind stimulated during the monotony is important. I’m a huge fan of classical and acoustic music when the need to focus is important. Even now, I’m listening to the “ <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/0PRs1Xaui4zCv9LdIIt20X">Acoustic Concentration</a>” playlist on Spotify. But when it comes to my commute, it’s easy for me to get tired and want to take a nap (something I’m trying very hard to avoid) so I find playlists good for weight-lifting workouts and other high-energy music. Also, making sure I have my morning coffee is very important.</p>

<p>During my reflection, I’ve also been thinking about everything that I’m thankful for. My life has changed a lot in the last couple of years, and first and foremost I want to thank my wife for that. I first met her about three and a half years ago, and it’s been a crazy ride for sure, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. We got married February 2014 and I can’t see myself spending my life with anyone else. She’s always a comfort for me and being around her makes me feel so relaxed and happy. Second, I’m thankful for my parents. They’ve always supported me in anything I’ve wanted to do and are still always there whenever I need help. I try not to ask for help from my parents whenever I can avoid it because I feel at this point in my life, I should be self-sufficient; at the same time, however, I know that it’s not always a bad thing to admit you need an extra boost from someone. It may not be parents, but instead friends, or other relatives. Things happen, and it’s good to have a support system in place to help deal with life’s unexpected turns.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>That’s all I have to talk about, today. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

        The Space in Which I Craft
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-08T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">08 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>One thing I’ve come to learn is that having a good writing space is important. For some, the room has to be just right. Darkness, music, closed doors. For others, like myself, I don’t need as much. I think it’s worth breaking down to a more manageable conversation.</p>

<h2 id="lights">Lights</h2>
<p>Some folks like to keep the room dark, some like it brightly lit. I’m in between. I have a free-standing lamp from IKEA that uses two bulbs and the shades are a fogged white. The bulbs themselves are hybrid 75-watt-incandescent-20-watt-cfl. This allows the lamp to be immediately lit with bright, warm light from the incandescent bulbs while the CFLs are warming up. When they have, the bulbs automagically switch over and you notice little change. At first I thought this was awesome but I’ve come to find out that GE makes simple CFLs that don’t need any warming in 75w-equivalent sizes for roughly $7 bucks a piece. Future lights in that lamp will be of that variety, for sure. Until then, I’m content with my moderate lighting setup. It’s not too bright (like an office), which I hate, because I feel it’s distracting, and it’s not super dark, because that would put me to sleep. Plus, I feel staring at an LCD screen in the pitch dark is more traumatizing to my eyes than it’s worth, really.</p>

<h2 id="coffee">Coffee</h2>
<p>This is my first post in this challenge and on my blog in particular where I wrote it before 6AM. I decided yesterday to hack my morning routine and start getting up earlier, to the more natural rhythm of my sleep cycles. I’ve almost got it down, already, just need a few more tweaks. To assist in the morning energization of my mind, a nice hot cup of coffee from my no-fuss Keurig coffee maker is a must. I don’t have time to grind and crap.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I like listening to classical music while I’m at work. It keeps me in a calm state, so I figured I’d give it a try while writing. As I write this post, I’m listing to a rather even playlist of classical music deemed for concentration on Spotify, the best $10/month investment in the world. Seriously, if you’re not in the market to spend a ton on music (classical is super cheap, anyway, so perhaps you should just go buy a few compilation albums for a couple bucks each on Amazon), Spotify is the way to go. I have so much classical music in several locations: roughly 4 days worth, end-to-end, from Amazon Music, that I spent a grand total of $6 on, a few albums from iTunes, and a half-dozen playlists on Spotify.</p>

<h2 id="past-struggles">Past Struggles</h2>
<p>In the past, I’ve had bouts where I haven’t written in months, and this point of this exercise is to reflect on wether my environment is the reason for it. In my case, I’m pretty happy with where I’m sitting, in my 2nd-bedroom-turned-office. My struggle hasn’t really been with my environment, but more with my dedication to writing, and just doing it more. I get bored with things, easily, if I stop having motivation to do them, including writing. I’ve written several things in the past that I thought were really good but shortly thereafter, I stopped feeling like writing, in favor of doing other things.</p>

<p>This time around, writing will be a part of my daily routine, no matter what I haven’t quite figured out what time of day yet, as this morning I started this at 5AM, but yesterday I started at 5:30PM. I guess so long as I’m writing every day, I can hammer out the finer points of my routine as I find a rhythm that I like. Until then, I just need to keep putting words to paper.</p>

        Why I Write

    <time datetime="2015-01-07T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>Part of this newfound journey I’m on to blog better is to look inward at myself and try to figure out why I write. It’s more difficult than it sounds because I feel I have two thoughts that form some sort of answer.</p>

<p><em>I have a thought, maybe two.</em></p>

<p>Sometimes there are topics and ideas that just sound interesting. Sometimes things are utterly stupid. Certain situations make stupid stuff interesting. I like to look at writing as me telling you what I think. By reading these words, you’re telling me you have at least a small interest in what I think.</p>

<h2 id="making-money-from-blogging-is-a-fine-line-to-walk">Making money from blogging is a fine line to walk.</h2>
<p>People don’t get rich off of blogging. People make money from ads. There’s a little part of me that hopes that some day I’ll strike it big, become famous, and my words will carry weight in the form of money bags, to the bank. I know this is a long shot and in the grand scheme of things, this is a terrible idea and hope to have as it might skew my writing. I want to be honest. Now that it’s out there, perhaps I’ll change my ways… only time will tell.</p>

<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have mashed potatoes calling my name…. get your own you damn dirty ape.</p>

        You Really Just Would not Understand!

<p>I’m hoping that someone can explain to me why in the literal hell I would think this is something I would wear.</p>

<p><strong><em>It’s just a Johnathan thing. You wouldn’t understand!</em></strong></p>

<p>Are you sure? At what point did I become such a pompous ass that everything I do, every action I take and word that comes out of my mouth raised to such a level that nobody on God’s green earth would understand it, even to a fraction of a degree? </p>

<p>At least they spelled my name right… spammers have a tendency to misspell my name at least a dozen times a day, according to my spam filter. Perhaps it’s time to make a new rule to filter out those who just don’t understand: If you email me, tweet me, or otherwise try to talk to me and you don’t spell my name right, I’m going to wear this god-forsaken sweatshirt, take a photo, send it to you, tell you go pound sand, and then run away laughing.</p>

<p>That sounds crazy, right? Well it’s a Johnathan thing… you wouldn’t understand.</p>

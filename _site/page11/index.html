        A Post I Wrote with Writed
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-07-09T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">09 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I’m always on the lookout for new and interesting apps that make the desktop writing experience more enjoyable. I’m a big fan of <a href="http://desk.pm">Desk</a> and <a href="http://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> and wondered what other kinds of markdown-based writing tools were out there.</p>

<p>A quick Google search turned up more than a few and I only had time to talk about one, tonight, so I picked a free entry in the space, <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a believer of having a good-quality, distraction-free writing environment to craft stories, blog posts, news articles, and even school papers*, one of the biggest things to me is the ability to go full-on distraction-free mode and be able to just write, without anything else getting in the way. Writed does the full-screen writing mode well with several styles to choose from. Since it was night when I wrote this, I found it suitable to sit by a lamp at my desk and use the Night theme. The contrast is good and I’m not struggling to see. Plus, if I darken the brightness of my screen, the dark grey background becomes almost black, and the words still pop.</p>

<h3 id="distraction-free">99% Distraction Free</h3>
<p>A word and character counter sit at the bottom of the screen, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to make that bar disappear, so strictly speaking, I’m not operating in full distraction-free mode like my favorites would alow me to do, but we’re close. To be honest, I like to see the numbers from time to time because it feels like I’m increasing some magical word score and I’m shooting for a high score. I have this odd fascination with things that allow me to attain exceedingly high scores with no real reward at the end but an even higher score.</p>

<h3 id="basic-markdown-support">Basic Markdown Support</h3>
<p>Writed does markdown writing well with it’s backtick ( ` ) code support, as well as proper emphasis with single and double-underscore and -asterisk support. Headers and code blocks work fine, as well as blockquoting with greater-than carats ( the &gt; symbol).</p>

<p>If I was going to chang anything about this application, I’d only do one thing: make the bottom bar something I can hide. Given that it’s a slightly different color in the theme, it stands out from the rest of the editing space and is just a smidge distracting. Other than that, I like <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a> and for the price of FREE with a couple optional in-app purchases, it’s super hard to say no to such an app that gets the basic markdown-centric-distraction-limited-writing-space job done.</p>

        Custom Domains on Medium

    <p>This is something I never knew existed. The <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> team posted <a href="https://medium.com/the-story/custom-domains-for-publications-8cb161d9651">this article</a> back in March about their limited beta launch of custom domains for publications that use Medium as a publishing platform.</p>

<p>The article isn’t super detailed about the whole process and there’s only a few publications on board as of the March 12, 2015 story, but this is something I’ve been wanting to see from Medium for a long time. Their publishing platform is awesome. It’s super easy to use and is formatted very well for long-form articles and stories that feature big and beautiful imagery.</p>

<p>My only hope is that they extend this to everyone at some point in time.</p>

        After 200 Posts&#8230; What&#8217;s Next?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-07-09T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">09 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I published my 200th blog post for the year, just <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed">a bit ago</a>, with a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed">review</a> of the free markdown editing app <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a>. It’s crazy to think that starting in <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/">January</a>, up until today, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/">July 9th</a>, I’ve written 200 blog posts (with this one being #201).</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure what the next 200 posts will hold, but I hope to be able to get them in before the end of the year. There’s a tad less than 1/2 of the calendar year to go so I’m looking at quite a challenge, but I was able to start strong in the beginning of the year so there’s no excuse why I can’t sit down and bust out 200 different things I want to talk about.</p>

<p>I have a lot on my mind.</p>

        Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-07-08T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">08 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I never thought I’d end up being a fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise. I haven’t so much as played any of the past titles including the ever popular Skyrim.</p>

<p>Then last weekend, while I was scrolling through the PlayStation Store on my PlayStation 4, I came across Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited. I was naturally a bit curious as I hadn’t followed the franchise much and wanted to know more about this unknown-to-me installment.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it wasn’t a new installment at all so much as it was an all-access pass to the Elder Scrolls Online world. Previously, people had to pay monthly for the game like those who play World of Warcraft and MMOs like it. Having a one-time fee of $60 seemed much more appealing to someone like me that might pick it up and put it down here and there and go a significant while without playing.</p>

<p>The last thing I wanted to do at this point in my gaming career (if you can call it that) was to end up spending $15-20 a month on a game that I only play for a few hours a week. The total cost of ownership would be much lower at this single price point, even at the same duration of play per month.</p>

<p>So I caved and bought it. Since it was a digital purchase, I more or less bought rights to play it, but that’s just semantics. I really thought I would be able to pick it up and start playing that same night. As it turns out, that wasn’t quite the case.</p>

<p>At almost 36GB for the main game and 18GB for the “update” to said game, I was in for a wait. A 55GB game is nothing to sneeze and and that gave me hope there would be a lot of content and a lot of places to explore.</p>

<p>The next day, long after it downloaded, I fired it up and jumped into the fray. This comes after spending a few hours the night before watching YouTube videos to partly learn about what’s going on and partly secretly justify my (probably) non-refundable purchase.</p>

<p>First impressions are important, and I wasn’t really disappointed. The visuals are on par with what I would expect from a current-generation game console at steady frame rates. The story is as fantasy as it can get. The interface took some getting used to as this is my first foray into the console-MMO space. Quest markers were the hardest parts to get down.</p>

<p>After several hours, I was hooked, however, and am glad I made the purchase. So far, I’ve sunk roughly 10 hours into the game and have just scratched the surface. I look forward to continuing my digital adventures with my character named NathanielIronbow. Cheesy, I know.</p>

        Wireless Streaming of Spotify (sort of)

    <time datetime="2015-07-02T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">02 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I’m not sure why I didn’t discover this earlier. My excitement when Spotify came to the PlayStation 4 was moderate and I’ve been using Spotify as an all-but-replacement for my rotting Apple iTunes (now Apple Music) library for some time.</p>

<p>One thing I never put together until today is that I can control what’s playing on my PlayStation 4 via Spotify on my Mac.</p>

<p>I’m sure this isn’t news to a lot of people, but it is to me, so you know what…?</p>

<p>…mind blown.</p>

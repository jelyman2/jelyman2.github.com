    <p>It’s been a couple weeks since I posted anything substantial, for good reason. Today is one of the first days I’ve had since the beginning of the month to sit down and write, now that the dust is settling. Moving is a big deal and is nothing short of a lot of work. Over the next few days, I’ll be sharing some of my adventures and experiences. After that, I’ll talk about what it’s like for a northwesterner in California, a state that’s had minimal rain since I arrived. I’ll give you a sneak peak: I’m already tan.</p>

<p>I chuckled at this one, because the struggle is real.</p>

<p>However, it got me to thinking. What are some of the small things in life that are actually quite enjoyable and satisfying?</p>

<p>I think for me, one of the most satisfying small things is when I sit down to write, I have this sudden flow of words, as if they came out of nowhere. I don’t have to look at my list of things I want to talk about, I don’t have to browse the Internet looking for inspiration.</p>

<p>It just happens.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>end game (n.) – the late or final stages of any activity.Thinking about what my goal for this blog is made me realize: I don’t have one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m ok with that. There’s something to be said about just wanting to do something because you can. I don’t play video games because at one point I’ll end up being a professional gamer and spending my life playing League of Legends for money. I don’t blog because one day I want to make this site a full time job earning money.</p>

<p>At least not right now.</p>

<p>There’s always the same thought that crosses my mind every once in a while regarding the slim possibility this site ever becomes famous or even just a smidgen popular. I have plans for my blog but none of them involve some masterful end goal.</p>

<p>As time progresses, things change. When traffic increases, perhaps it’ll be time to focus on specific topics or themes. Right now, I ramble most of the time and post generic stuff. Sometimes there’s a theme, sometimes not.</p>

<p>I know people read this but I also know more people would read it if they found it interesting to them.</p>

<p>Right now though,t it doesn’t really matter. I write because I can, because I want to. I write because it frankly feels good to me. Some people knit, some paint. Writing makes me feel like I accomplished something.</p>

<p>As long as I can continue to do just that, I don’t need an end goal. And end is an exit. I don’t want to exit from writing.</p>

<p>Deep. Or is it? It’s hard to say.</p>

<p>This is one of those short films that really leave you thinking. What was it that we actually saw? What does it all mean? I dunno, but it was damn cool to watch.</p>

<p>Did I mention that Warner Bros. is <a href="http://deadline.com/2015/03/sundays-viral-short-film-warner-bros-mischa-rozema-1201399435/">picking it up</a> to do a movie?</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-25T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">25 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>Acid Reflux sucks. I don’t typically suffer from such things but lately it’s been rough. Part of this big (to me) move is having to leave a place I grew up and essentially spent all of my living years behind. Compound that with everything that’s going into moving and the amount of money it really does cost to move. Don’t think you can move for cheap… that’s just not a thing.</p>

<p>One thing that’s been quite interesting, however, is the closer I get to the magic date, the better I feel. When everything first became a reality, I was stupid scared. I didn’t sleep well if at all, I constantly missed my alarm, wasn’t productive throughout the day, etc. It sucked.</p>

<p>As time has passed and I’m getting closer to April 4th, I’m starting to be okay with the idea. I’ve moved my Comcast service, I’ve set up utilities, paid some deposits, looked into things to do in the area, how the city works, etc. I’ve also allotted myself a few days before I start working at my new job to relax and enjoy the area. I know one of the first things I want to do the morning after we move in is sit on my deck and watch the sun rise. Hell yeah that sounds nice.</p>

<p>In Washington, I wouldn’t have the slightest opportunity to do that: we have too many tall trees and my deck faces south surrounded by those damn tall trees. In Cali, I’ll have an uninterrupted view of the east with just gentle rolling hills.</p>

<p>It’s thing like that that make me okay with the whole thing. I look at the weather and see it’s going to be sunny and not sad like it is in Washington. I see it’ll be warmer all around so I don’t have to wear layers to combat 37 degrees and wind and then try to pack them home in the afternoon with 55 and all sun.</p>

<p>Just writing about all this is making me feel less stressed out. Reflecting on all the new and cool that I’ll get to experience is making things easier on me. I’ve moved past the grieving stage and have accepted my departure as fact. The last hurdle I’ll have to jump is two days of driving. If we were driving in a car and not a moving truck, we could do it in one day (12.5 hours non-stop).</p>

<p>While the effects of stress still leave an effect on me every once in a while, it’s not as bad as it could be, I’m getting tired of chewing Alka Seltzer Heartburn Chewables. They taste flavorful until they ever so smoothly remind you that they’re chalky and full of hatred.</p>

    <p>I’m always looking for interesting things I can do to my site and the series underneath if it means providing some sort of benefit, even if just a small one. I also like learning, so I got the best of both worlds when I took the time a few days ago to set up <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> as a front-end cache for WordPress.</p>

<p>Installing it was dead simple. I already had the PHP <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/redis">PECL module</a> installed, so all I needed to do was <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis">install it via apt-get</a>, install a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/">WordPress plugin</a>, and I’m on my way. It took less than ten minutes. Way cool.</p>

<p>Page loads drops by about half. I like that.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-23T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">23 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>I’ve kept this site going with mostly daily content for the last few months now, and I’m quite impressed with how far it’s come. It’s no money maker, for sure. It likely never will be. At some point, this address won’t even point to a blog, but a more professional presentation of me. This blog will be delegated to its own address with its own name.</p>

<p>But that’s a project for another time. Right now, I want to reflect on why I do this.</p>

<p>I don’t blog because all the cool kids are doing it. I don’t blog because it’s my job. I don’t blog because I have something I want the entire world to hear or read. I blog because I can. Plain and simple. I do it because have thoughts and things I want to talk about to whomever will listen and this is the best way to do that without annoying the hell out of someone.</p>

<p>I blog because it’s the right thing to do. I could keep all my thoughts and words to myself, but what’s the fun in that? What’s the point? The truth of the matter is, you’re not protecting yourself from anyone by doing that.</p>

<p>I also don’t care if my thoughts don’t elicit the proper responses. I’m telling a story, explaining something, or just flat out offering my opinion. Whether people like it or not is up to them and at the end of the day, all I’m doing is blogging… because I can.</p>

<p>I set up this site originally as a portal for just that. After having jlyman.net for a couple years and not really doing anything with it, I decided it would make for a good home for this project. Coincidentally, having this site has also kept my mind fresh regarding self-hosting a site and all that goes into it.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’d have the same attachment to it if I used a managed service. I think that gives me an advantage regarding staying the course.</p>

<p>That and I have lots to say.</p>

    <p>I want to pass on that I’m aware of all the missing images a lot of my posts have. Somewhere during an image processing sweep a lot of them never finished and thus are now basically invalid files. I’m working on restoring them.

    <p>I’m always looking for new ways to learn how to code. Up until recently, I had no idea where to really start with Swift, the language used to craft iOS apps and games that mades its appearance in iOS 8.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I came across Swifty, a free app (with a couple in-app purchases) that teaches you the basics of iOS programming. I recommend you go check it out on the App Store. It’s a great way to get started and with no cost for entry, if you don’t like it, you’re not out any money. It’s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swifty-learn-to-code-in-swift!/id886315617?mt=8">available for both the iPhone and iPad</a>.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-22T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">22 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>Two weeks from the day I write this, we’ll be on the road headed south. If I have my way, we’ll be at our half-way point and relaxing into the evening.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s two weeks from now. In present day, I’m sitting here with a mostly empty home.</p>

<p>One of the things we decided to do was sell most of our furniture to a) make room for new stuff, b) get better fuel economy, and c) make a few extra bucks by giving furniture to people who need it.</p>

<p>It’s been harder than I thought in terms of parting with items that have essentially been with us since the beginning. We sold what really was our first couch, a couch donated to us by my wife’s parents. It wasn’t anything special, but it helped us out immensely and it became a staple in our living room for the next three years. </p>

<p>Fast forward to now, and we sold it last week on Craigslist for a very small fee. I don’t know what it was off the top of my head but I feel like it was somewhere around $50. That’s not a lot, and we weren’t expecting to sell it for a lot, because it’s a simple couch and wasn’t new by any means. </p>

<p>What’s important to tell about this story isn’t that we sold a couch for chump change compared to a new one, it’s to whom it was sold. </p>

<p>The buyers of our starter couch were a young couple, like us. They were moving to a new home and didn’t have any furniture to start. For this story, I’m assuming it’s their first solo space together, given their age. They looked like they were in their early 20s, maybe 22. While I’m only a few years older, I can remember what it felt like just a few years ago to try to scrape together enough to buy furniture.</p>

<p>This wonderful young couple also nabbed a couple night stands from us, too, for their new space. We helped them load the furniture and sent them on their way. I’m sure they’ll be able to put the couch to good use, just like we did. If they only have it for a year, it’ll have served its purpose. Perhaps they’ll sell it to someone else who will be in need, too, and it can continue on its journey providing butt comfort for new home owners.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only story I have about people who’ve come and obtained furniture from us. A lady came by today to pick up our coffee table. Her and her partner are moving into a larger space from a tiny Seattle urban apartment. </p>

<p>Another person bought our bed frame and dresser from us. He was recovering from breaking up with his girlfriend of a long time (I want to say seven years). She wanted to get married, and he wasn’t ready for such commitments. (Yes, I know seven years is a long time to be with someone and what’s marriage at that point, right? I don’t know what to tell you, here. I wasn’t there to ask the guy questions)</p>

<p>At the time I write this, there’s only two pieces left: the entertainment center that houses my networking gear, the Playstation 4, and the TV as well as the desk at which I sit to write this post. It’ll be hardest for me to get rid of this desk because I enjoy my daily ritual of writing. It’s what I usually do in the morning to keep stimulated.</p>

<p>I know things are going to be a bit crazy for a few weeks and I’ve already come to terms with the idea that I won’t be writing as much. I guess I could still sit at our dining room table. That’s the one piece of hard furniture that isn’t from IKEA and solid wood. We just bought it and I like it. I’m putting my foot down there. Sure I could put my foot down at my desk, but I could go for a simpler space, too. I don’t need drawers. Just a flat surface to put my laptop down on, maybe room for a notepad to write on, and my basic pull-cord lamp, powered by the one LED lightbulb we own.</p>

<p>It’s honestly been rough coming to the realization that we’re moving soon. I’ve lived her my whole life and in two weeks we start fresh somewhere totally new for both of us. What’s made it easier to swallow is seeing our stuff go to good homes where people need it. Our dump run will be minimal and we already made a Goodwill run, today, where other stuff of ours will find a home and be used by someone, somewhere. </p>

<p>One thing about life is that things always change and change can be scary but it can also be good.</p>

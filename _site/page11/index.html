    <p>This was the day we were all waiting for. The day we drive into town, unload the truck, and start our lives in California. This was also the day I forgot how much I don’t like moving up and down stairs.</p>

<p>When I pulled in, I barely fit. The power steering was whining because I insisted on holding the wheel all the way to the right. The truck fit, and the trailer followed behind, by only by a hair. Mere inches were between my front bumper and the gate edge, and same with my trailer wheels. Someone didn’t think the entrance through enough.</p>

<p>Either way, I found a place to park the truck and get rid of the trailer so we could unload. It was warm, but not super hot… 60-something, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>It only took a few hours to unload the truck when we counted breaks. Having help was nice, especially when it came to conquering the three flights of stairs. Before dinner, we were done and the truck was back where it belonged.</p>

<p>So glad it’s over.</p>

    <p>The Siskiyous mountains are rough for a moving truck. At times we hummed along at 55 to 60 mph and when we hit big climbs, we sputtered at 35 to 40. It’s rough going for a gas-powered truck-trailer. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, please let me fill you in.</p>

<p>Gas-powered trucks have zero oomph when pulling a load. None. Their torque is present at a much higher rev range than diesel and unfortunately, those higher revs also sit close to the engine’s limit. I wanted to give the truck 100% throttle to power up the hills, but if I did, I felt it would explode. See, to make our journey up a 7% grade even at 40 mph, the engine needed to run at 4000-4250 RPM. For scale, the gauge stops at 6000 and the truck shifts well before then. I was at my limit.</p>

<p>Even with such slow and gas-guzzling climbs, we managed to stay on target for fuel usage and didn’t lose too much time. The most embarrassing part: loaded semi trucks passing you. Damn you, Budget Truck.</p>

<p>After we got out of the mountains, we made a quick pit stop in Redding, CA to top off and sprinted to Sacramento, where we met friends for our last night on the road.</p>

    <p>Now the real fun begins. There’s nothing more that I’ve wanted from life than to drive a 40’ truck-trailer combination over 900 miles. Today’s journey took us to Medford, OR, where we make our first of two on-the-road stops.</p>

<p>We chose to stay in the Ramada, and it’d been so long since I stayed in a place like that I forgot what it was like. Apparently, they opted to not redecorate since I last stayed in one in the 90s. The hotel was crap. I’m not sure it was worth the $64 a night price tag, but at least the WiFi was good. It was great actually. Probably because nobody was actually staying there besides truckers. The bed was hard and the breakfast was meh, but it did its job as a place to sleep for the night. Medford is a surprisingly beautiful area. The south Oregon mountains are awesome and quite a site to see, compared to the rest of the state.</p>

<p>Not much happened on the journey south. We sat in the truck for nine hours including stops, filled up once with what seemed like an entire tanker of gas, and somehow managed 12mpg, with car trailer. I was quite impressed, but at the same time, not. Budget really needs to stop using gas engines in their tow-capable trucks. We could have skipped a stop if we were rolling in a diesel truck.</p>

<p>I experienced a Popeye’s for the second time in my life. The first time involved me wishing I hadn’t experienced Popeye’s. This time, it was actually decent, but considering this was the fourth or fifth meal involving fast food, I was starting to feel pretty gross.</p>

<p>The bane of my existence has yet to come, however.</p>

    <p>Today’s the day. We packed up all our stuff over the last couple of weeks and picked up our moving truck this morning. We loaded it all in a relatively short amount of time (we do only have an apartment, after all). So far, the trip’s been alright, as we haven’t left town, yet, and won’t until tomorrow morning. Funny story, though…</p>

<p>We were up at 6:30 getting ready to start the long day. I’m dreading the level of effort that’s about to be bestowed upon me by the laws of gravity and physics. By 7:30 we had breakfast. Thanks Jack in the Box!</p>

<p>By 8:00am, we were at the rental truck facility. By virtue of being the lowest price for our one-way trip, we graced Budget Truck with our presence. The place looked kinda sketchy and rightly so: it was nothing more than a double-wide. For a place that also offered rental cars via Avis, it was hard to tell what cars were actually available to rent.</p>

<p>At 8:30 we had the truck back home and ready to accept our crap. Most of our stuff was already boxed up so it came down to making trips two and from the truck with the dolly. This part only took a couple hours. Most of our furniture was boxed up (we ordered some new stuff, because why not!).</p>

<p>Come 10:30 and we’re back at Budget Truck ready for our car trailer. We’re taking a 22-foot truck (16 feet cargo space plus six feet for the chassis, give or take) and adding another 16.5-foot trailer on the back. I love the plan. This $45 trailer will net us $150 in gas savings.</p>

<p>Did I mention we have a cat? No? Well… we have a cat, and this is where it starts getting interesting.</p>

<p>It’s now 12:00 and we’re at our hotel, the Holiday In Express &amp; Suites. I’ve stayed there before and they were pretty nice for a 3-star hotel. I expected more nice-but-not-worthy-of-instagramming experiences. We checked in, and informed them of our cat, because I want to make sure the reservation at a pet-friendly hotel was still legitimate. Turns out it was, they are pet friendly. As it also turns out, they charge $50 per three nights as an added fee, like paying for a room for your pet. Oh… but according to Hanna, the wonderfully nice woman at the reception desk explained the moment she, herself discovered for the first time it seemed, they don’t take cats.</p>

<p>So there’s that.</p>

<p>I’m in a bit of a subdued panic because our whole schedule is pretty well locked down. We already turned in our apartment keys and for all intents and purposes, we’re transients. I’ll be honest, I paid $90 for my room through Hotwire. I thought it was a good deal. That’s about the price I paid the last time I stayed at HIES via Hotwire, roughly two to three years ago.</p>

<p>I give Hotwire a call, crossing my fingers they’ll refund my non-refundable purchase. Turns out they will, only if the room and or reservation isn’t as advertised. I had the right in two areas: 1) they were only <em>partially</em> pet friendly, something Hotwire didn’t advertise properly, and 2) the rate on Hotwire’s site should have been the only amount I had to pay, which it wasn’t. After roughly five minutes, it was all squared away and I had my money back.</p>

<p>But now what? I’m without a hotel room. In comes my trusty hotel sidekick to the rescue.</p>

<p>There’s a single hotel chain that’s always come through for my family and my wife’s family alike, the La Quinta. It’s roughly on the same level as HIES, and about the same price. I gave them a rang because I know their properties and know what kind of rooms they offer up. An ever so friendly gentleman named Kurtis (I checked, he spells it that way) helped us out. They had a room open tonight and they were pet friendly. They also don’t charge a fee, because that’s weird.</p>

<p>Since I’m a AAA member, they took 10% off and we were in business for $100. Sure it was $10 more, but I’d rather pay that difference than $50. It was within reason. Within 20 minutes we had our room and were moving in for the night.</p>

<p>It’s 1:00pm and nap time.</p>

<p>At around 3:30, my wife found it prudent to give our other hotel reservations a call and find out if they charge a separate pet fee. Turns out they both did. The Ramada in Medford, OR charges $20, and the Double Tree in Newark, CA charges $50. The $20 is okay, the $50 is not. I called Hotwire again, and complained once more. I fed them a story about false advertising and whatnot, and within a few minutes I had my money back, again. It would be great if Hotwire advertised extra fees like this before you buy your supposedly non-refundable stay.</p>

<p>I enjoyed our stay at the La Quinta. While it’s nothing special to look at they’re good at making breakfast and having comfy beds. They could step up their WiFi game a bit. The particular hotel I stayed at had misconfigured WiFi. All of their hotspots were on the same channel. If you’re not technically inclined enough to know what that means, let me use this analogy: imagine six people talking to you at the same time, at the same volume, saying the same thing. Which one are you going to pay attention to? With all of the hotel’s hotspots on the same frequency, doing the same thing, the airwaves become a garbled mess, and my laptop had a hard time staying connected. Noob move.</p>

<p>Overall, our first day was uneventful. We packed up and rested. The real fun begins on day two.</p>

    <p>It’s been a couple weeks since I posted anything substantial, for good reason. Today is one of the first days I’ve had since the beginning of the month to sit down and write, now that the dust is settling. Moving is a big deal and is nothing short of a lot of work. Over the next few days, I’ll be sharing some of my adventures and experiences. After that, I’ll talk about what it’s like for a northwesterner in California, a state that’s had minimal rain since I arrived. I’ll give you a sneak peak: I’m already tan.</p>

<p>I chuckled at this one, because the struggle is real.</p>

<p>However, it got me to thinking. What are some of the small things in life that are actually quite enjoyable and satisfying?</p>

<p>I think for me, one of the most satisfying small things is when I sit down to write, I have this sudden flow of words, as if they came out of nowhere. I don’t have to look at my list of things I want to talk about, I don’t have to browse the Internet looking for inspiration.</p>

<p>It just happens.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>end game (n.) – the late or final stages of any activity.Thinking about what my goal for this blog is made me realize: I don’t have one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m ok with that. There’s something to be said about just wanting to do something because you can. I don’t play video games because at one point I’ll end up being a professional gamer and spending my life playing League of Legends for money. I don’t blog because one day I want to make this site a full time job earning money.</p>

<p>At least not right now.</p>

<p>There’s always the same thought that crosses my mind every once in a while regarding the slim possibility this site ever becomes famous or even just a smidgen popular. I have plans for my blog but none of them involve some masterful end goal.</p>

<p>As time progresses, things change. When traffic increases, perhaps it’ll be time to focus on specific topics or themes. Right now, I ramble most of the time and post generic stuff. Sometimes there’s a theme, sometimes not.</p>

<p>I know people read this but I also know more people would read it if they found it interesting to them.</p>

<p>Right now though,t it doesn’t really matter. I write because I can, because I want to. I write because it frankly feels good to me. Some people knit, some paint. Writing makes me feel like I accomplished something.</p>

<p>As long as I can continue to do just that, I don’t need an end goal. And end is an exit. I don’t want to exit from writing.</p>

<p>Deep. Or is it? It’s hard to say.</p>

<p>This is one of those short films that really leave you thinking. What was it that we actually saw? What does it all mean? I dunno, but it was damn cool to watch.</p>

<p>Did I mention that Warner Bros. is <a href="http://deadline.com/2015/03/sundays-viral-short-film-warner-bros-mischa-rozema-1201399435/">picking it up</a> to do a movie?</p>

    <p>Acid Reflux sucks. I don’t typically suffer from such things but lately it’s been rough. Part of this big (to me) move is having to leave a place I grew up and essentially spent all of my living years behind. Compound that with everything that’s going into moving and the amount of money it really does cost to move. Don’t think you can move for cheap… that’s just not a thing.</p>

<p>One thing that’s been quite interesting, however, is the closer I get to the magic date, the better I feel. When everything first became a reality, I was stupid scared. I didn’t sleep well if at all, I constantly missed my alarm, wasn’t productive throughout the day, etc. It sucked.</p>

<p>As time has passed and I’m getting closer to April 4th, I’m starting to be okay with the idea. I’ve moved my Comcast service, I’ve set up utilities, paid some deposits, looked into things to do in the area, how the city works, etc. I’ve also allotted myself a few days before I start working at my new job to relax and enjoy the area. I know one of the first things I want to do the morning after we move in is sit on my deck and watch the sun rise. Hell yeah that sounds nice.</p>

<p>In Washington, I wouldn’t have the slightest opportunity to do that: we have too many tall trees and my deck faces south surrounded by those damn tall trees. In Cali, I’ll have an uninterrupted view of the east with just gentle rolling hills.</p>

<p>It’s thing like that that make me okay with the whole thing. I look at the weather and see it’s going to be sunny and not sad like it is in Washington. I see it’ll be warmer all around so I don’t have to wear layers to combat 37 degrees and wind and then try to pack them home in the afternoon with 55 and all sun.</p>

<p>Just writing about all this is making me feel less stressed out. Reflecting on all the new and cool that I’ll get to experience is making things easier on me. I’ve moved past the grieving stage and have accepted my departure as fact. The last hurdle I’ll have to jump is two days of driving. If we were driving in a car and not a moving truck, we could do it in one day (12.5 hours non-stop).</p>

<p>While the effects of stress still leave an effect on me every once in a while, it’s not as bad as it could be, I’m getting tired of chewing Alka Seltzer Heartburn Chewables. They taste flavorful until they ever so smoothly remind you that they’re chalky and full of hatred.</p>

    <p>I’m always looking for interesting things I can do to my site and the series underneath if it means providing some sort of benefit, even if just a small one. I also like learning, so I got the best of both worlds when I took the time a few days ago to set up <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> as a front-end cache for WordPress.</p>

<p>Installing it was dead simple. I already had the PHP <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/redis">PECL module</a> installed, so all I needed to do was <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis">install it via apt-get</a>, install a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/">WordPress plugin</a>, and I’m on my way. It took less than ten minutes. Way cool.</p>

<p>Page loads drops by about half. I like that.</p>

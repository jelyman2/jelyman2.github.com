    <p>What do you think about when I say the words “you’re an amateur at living life?”</p>

<p>Think about that for a moment. </p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=YQM2YDP3UUCJ7UF6">Pressfield</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we hate our lives and ourselves, two models present themselves as modes of salvation.The first is the therapeutic model. In the therapeutic model, we are told (or we tell ourselves ) that we are “sick.” What ails us is a “ <strong>condition</strong> ” or a “ <strong>disease</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second way is the moralistic model. The moralistic model is about good and evil. The reason we are unhappy, we are told (or tell ourselves) is that we have done something “ <strong>wrong</strong>.” We have committed a “crime” or a “sin.”</p>

<p>We’ve established two potential outcomes for how we’ll treat ourselves if we’re not where we want to be in life or aren’t good at something we wish we were good at. That sound like a pretty noob way of thinking. The ultimate goal should be not to knock down but to hack and slash the crap away. In turn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We find our will and our voice and we find our self-respect. We become who we always were but had, until then, been afraid to embrace and to live out.That’s the end goal but it won’t happen overnight.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took me a long time to come to terms with the idea that I had ambition. I felt guilty about it. Who was I to aspire to “rise above” my brothers and sisters or to aim to be “better” than anybody else?The words of a quitter… are you a quitter? I sure as shit am not. There are days when I feel like I should just give up but I never do because that’s me looking for an easy way out and not finding one. There’s never an easy way out of life. This includes suicide. That’s not an easy way out. There’s nothing easy about leaving your friends, family, and the world behind forever. There’s no such thing as a random act of suicide. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest driver of turning pro is ambition. Without it, failure is imminent. </p>

    <p>I’m almost positive I’ll receive flack for this from people who think I’m talking out my ass, and that’s fine. Recently, it has come to light that certain model Lenovo laptops were shipping with what most would chalk up to nothing more than adware, a.k.a Superfish. For a few months at the end of 2014, consumer grade Lenovo laptops received this software that hijacks web browsing sessions ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a> included) and injecting them with ads it feels you’ll appreciate.</p>

<p>By that description, about every adware out there is on the same level, and probably is viewed all the same by Lenovo. Curious enough, this software wasn’t ever present on any business-class laptop or desktop like the ThinkPad or X1.</p>

<p>This type of attack is what’s referred to as a MITM or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man-in-the-Middle</a> attack. It sits quietly between you and whatever your destination is on the web and picks out and replaces bits as it sees fit. In this case, these bits were ads. Typically this isn’t easily done, if at all, with secured traffic (identified with <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://</code> in the address) but Superfish took it one step further, and packaged their adware with an additional root certificate that masquerades as being owned by whichever secure site you visit. A typical user probably wouldn’t ever notice this as their browser would show the site is secure and the certificate is for said site. A few seconds of clicking around would reveal that certificate isn’t actually owned by the site (or company) being visited, exposing the catastrophic problem.</p>

<p>What makes this even worse is Lenovo claims they though their users would <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-honestly-thought-youd-enjoy-that-superfish-https-spyware/">enjoy it</a>. I don’t have much else to say surrounding that. It seems pretty self-explanatory that Lenovo’s consumer division is an idiot.</p>

<p>Some more technically inclined people would catch on to this right away and make the necessary changes to pull the root CA and be on their merry way. Others would wipe their system and install Windows fresh from the get-go without any of the bloatware or extra crap to this day still ships on some consumer PCs.</p>

<p>_ <strong>Pro Tip</strong> : If you want a retail machine that doesn’t ship with shit, buy a business desktop or laptop. You’ll have a much better time._</p>

<p>If you’re interested in knowing more about wiping your PC the easy way or cleaning it up without all the hassle, Paul Thurrott has <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/tag/clean-pc">great articles on his site</a> for doing that.</p>

<p>If you’re more adventurous, you could wipe the root CA away yourself with some help from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-to-remove-the-superfish-malware-what-lenovo-doesnt-tell-you/">this article</a> by Ars Technica.</p>

<p>Windows Defender has new functionality to clean out this adware, as highlighted by Microsoft, so <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/windows-defender-now-removes-superfish-malware-if-youre-lucky/">running it might also solve your problems</a>, if you’re one of the few users running one of these systems.</p>

<p>But let’s talk about my original statement in the title of this post. This wouldn’t have ever happened on a Mac. I know I say crap like that all the time, and while it’s true, I understand how it can sound douchey. Too bad I don’t care. One of the many reasons I bought a mac was for security. I know that computers are inherently safer if people aren’t attacking them but with the market share in the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/07/mac-achieves-highest-u-s-pc-market-share-ever-in-q3-2014-according-to-idc/">double digits</a> now, an attacker could still stand to gain a bit from Mac users.</p>

<p>Windows PCs have been plagued with pre-loaded crap for years. Back in the mid-2000s, they came with a literal boat load of freeware, shareware, trial software, and other adrific crap no one wanted. It was how the PCs became so cheap after a time. Today, they’re still cheap, and like the above scenario, <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/174587/refreshing-your-pc-wont-help-why-bloatware-is-still-a-problem-on-windows-8/">still holding crap nobody wants</a>.</p>

<p>Something Apple does will is keep a tight grip on the shipping product. There aren’t companies stuffing their crap into Apple systems of any kind so Apple <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/163303/how-computer-manufacturers-are-paid-to-make-your-laptop-worse/">can make an additional few dollars and random companies can do the same</a>. The out-of-the-box experience has always been a big deal for Apple and while us Mac users might be paying a premium, we’re also being spared from massive security holes and the like created by third parties and purposely installed by our computer manufacturer.</p>

<p>I’m not going to try and deny fake SSL certificates can’t appear on a Mac. It’s possible, for sure. The key here is Apple doesn’t ship with them.</p>

<p>Microsoft claims to be doing some good work in this area with their Signature Edition PCs you’ll probably only find in Microsoft Stores. It’s a bit cheesy but their site describes <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store?SiteID=msusa&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;Action=ContentTheme&amp;pbPage=MicrosoftSignature&amp;ThemeID=33363200">how much faster your new Windows PC can be</a> if you bought it from Microsoft instead of that cheap ass PC OEM. You know it’s a sad day when Microsoft is taking advantage of the situations their own OEMs have created (the same ones that buy Windows OEM licenses from them) in order to make some extra cash. It’s pretty much a double-dip on Microsoft’s part and they’re enjoying it, I’m sure.</p>

<p>While I write this on my Mac, let’s not forget not every manufacturer does this. Be sure they’re being watched even closer now by security experts who are waiting for the day the next batch of PCs comes out with vulnerability-laden crap.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re interested: Superfish has gone silent. I guess they won’t be needing those new iOS developers they’re hiring for, after all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn’t talk to anybody during my year of turning pro. I didn’t hang out. I just worked. I had a book in mind and I had decided I would finish it or kill myself. I could not run away again, or let people down again, or let myself down again. This was it, <strong>do or die</strong>.While maybe a tad extreme, it has an extremely powerful point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At what point do we nut up or shut up? Shit or get off the pot? If we can’t take the heat, we get out of the kitchen. All these metaphors mean the same thing, as you see just above in deliciously bold characters:  <strong>do or die</strong>.</p>

<p>When in a scenario where I have to think about the fact that if I don’t do something, a metric ton of consequences will follow, I think about one thing: why the hell am I pondering not doing and instead considering dying? I’m not literally dying in these situations, but I might as well be killing my goals and dreams.</p>

<p>I’ve pondered a lot about the idea that choosing to not do something equates to taking two steps back and every positive move is just one step forward. It’s easy to get lost in the weeds.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even doing doesn’t pan out. Spending all that time on that thing yielded zero other things. What was the point? Sticking to it and giving 100% is the point. That’s how you become a pro.</p>

<p>These are things I think about. Why am I in the job I’m in? Because it’s the next step. Why does it suck? Because I decided it sucks.</p>

<p>I’ve been pondering my career more and more as I approach May. If you haven’t been following along a lot or ever, really, I’m moving out of state in May for the foreseeable future. At least seven to ten years of my life will be in another state, doing other things. It’s up to me to make those things as kickass and valuable as possible. I either do, or I die.</p>

    <p>We’re always striving for more. We always want to have the competitive edge, to have just a bit more money, to look just a bit better. Sometimes, when we get to that level we want for ourselves, we’re not exactly thrilled with what we find.</p>

    <p>Social media is all around us at this point. It’s hard to avoid a conversation or an interaction with someone without it involving some sort of social media communication. One could argue that it’s the more current version of email, text messaging, and letter writing of days, decades, and centuries past, sure. I’m not entirely sure where I stand on it. I enjoy checking things out on Facebook, I <a href="http://instagram.com/jlymanphoto">post my photography</a> to Instagram, I <a href="http://twitter.com/theejl">tweet</a>… but I enjoy a good face-to-face conversation, too… </p>

    <p>I am super stoke to see Desk reach version 1.2. I’m also stoked to see a bunch of stuff fixed or improved that I was itching for!</p>

<p>I’ve been a user of desk for the last month and change, and I’m still really enjoying the app. It’s simple and it practically forces me to think about writing first. A couple of the biggest changes that I was looking forward to were the ability to adjust view amount of screen real estate being used for text (and the fact that it’s adjustable), and the spacing between paragraphs has been fixed. The issue surrounding odd spacing showing up in the editor when text was stylized seems to be fixed, too, which is a nice plus!</p>

<p>If you’re not a Desk user, go download it now. It’s $30 on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk-write-more/id915839505?mt=12">Mac App Store</a> and well worth the price!</p>

    <p>I picked up The Martian by way of a recommendation a friend gave me. I’ve seen it on the shelf for a minute now and I’m pretty excited to start listening to it. Most books I don’t read (a <a href="http://jlyman.net/turning-pro">recent purchase</a> being an exception) but instead listen to via Audible. If you’re not an Audible user, give them a shot. Like everything else I recommend, I am an Audible user and greatly enjoy their service. If you want a listen along with me, <a href="http://go.jlyman.net/audibleft30">click here</a> to sign up for a free trial and get a <strong>two</strong> free books to keep, even if you hate the service. I’ll be updating occasionally, like a digital book club of sorts, as I progress through the book. I’m excited!</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong> Turns out my info was a bit off. Instead of a free audiobook, you get  <strong>two</strong> free audiobooks. Oops!</p>

    <p>I picked up a new book yesterday morning by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turning-Pro-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B0087TUM54">Steven Pressfield called Turning Pro</a>. Actually, I downloaded it to my iPad with the Amazon Kindle app (does anyone actually “pick up” books anymore?). I’m quite intrigued so far with what the author has to say. He sounds like he’s seen some stuff and went through a lot of trials in life before finding the path that leads to success and meaningful contribution to life. There’s no magic key, no one-step process to instant awesomeness. It takes work. As I keep reading, I’ll share some thoughts that I have. So far, I’m impressed with seeing from where Pressfield has come and how much effort he put into turning himself around and doing more than the menial. He was even a truck driver at one point. And he lived in a cabin in the woods. That’s pretty interesting.</p>

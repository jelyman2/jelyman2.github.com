    <p>We’re always striving for more. We always want to have the competitive edge, to have just a bit more money, to look just a bit better. Sometimes, when we get to that level we want for ourselves, we’re not exactly thrilled with what we find.</p>

    <p>Social media is all around us at this point. It’s hard to avoid a conversation or an interaction with someone without it involving some sort of social media communication. One could argue that it’s the more current version of email, text messaging, and letter writing of days, decades, and centuries past, sure. I’m not entirely sure where I stand on it. I enjoy checking things out on Facebook, I <a href="http://instagram.com/jlymanphoto">post my photography</a> to Instagram, I <a href="http://twitter.com/theejl">tweet</a>… but I enjoy a good face-to-face conversation, too… </p>

    <p>I am super stoke to see Desk reach version 1.2. I’m also stoked to see a bunch of stuff fixed or improved that I was itching for!</p>

<p>I’ve been a user of desk for the last month and change, and I’m still really enjoying the app. It’s simple and it practically forces me to think about writing first. A couple of the biggest changes that I was looking forward to were the ability to adjust view amount of screen real estate being used for text (and the fact that it’s adjustable), and the spacing between paragraphs has been fixed. The issue surrounding odd spacing showing up in the editor when text was stylized seems to be fixed, too, which is a nice plus!</p>

<p>If you’re not a Desk user, go download it now. It’s $30 on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk-write-more/id915839505?mt=12">Mac App Store</a> and well worth the price!</p>

    <p>I picked up The Martian by way of a recommendation a friend gave me. I’ve seen it on the shelf for a minute now and I’m pretty excited to start listening to it. Most books I don’t read (a <a href="http://jlyman.net/turning-pro">recent purchase</a> being an exception) but instead listen to via Audible. If you’re not an Audible user, give them a shot. Like everything else I recommend, I am an Audible user and greatly enjoy their service. If you want a listen along with me, <a href="http://go.jlyman.net/audibleft30">click here</a> to sign up for a free trial and get a <strong>two</strong> free books to keep, even if you hate the service. I’ll be updating occasionally, like a digital book club of sorts, as I progress through the book. I’m excited!</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong> Turns out my info was a bit off. Instead of a free audiobook, you get  <strong>two</strong> free audiobooks. Oops!</p>

    <p>I picked up a new book yesterday morning by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turning-Pro-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B0087TUM54">Steven Pressfield called Turning Pro</a>. Actually, I downloaded it to my iPad with the Amazon Kindle app (does anyone actually “pick up” books anymore?). I’m quite intrigued so far with what the author has to say. He sounds like he’s seen some stuff and went through a lot of trials in life before finding the path that leads to success and meaningful contribution to life. There’s no magic key, no one-step process to instant awesomeness. It takes work. As I keep reading, I’ll share some thoughts that I have. So far, I’m impressed with seeing from where Pressfield has come and how much effort he put into turning himself around and doing more than the menial. He was even a truck driver at one point. And he lived in a cabin in the woods. That’s pretty interesting.</p>

<p>Creativity is an act of expression using unique methods to convey your thoughts and ideas. We have many forms of creative expression available to us in these times, however it didn’t used to be that way. Creative expression was limited and people who stepped outside the box create by the government or the church were doomed to punishment or worse. Don’t ever take for granted the amount of opportunity you have to share your voice, however small you think it may be. Should the day ever come where we look back on ourselves and witness the changes that happened right under our noses and we kept our thoughts and our voices to ourselves, we will be filled with deep regret and sadness.</p>

    <p>I want to talk for a minute about a particular service I really enjoy and have been using since 2012. I also want to be very clear that I’m not being paid to write this. I only endorse products and services I actually use. As of this writing I do not gain a percentage of any sales made in relation to this article. </p>

<p>Now that we have that out of the way, let’s talk about backing up your computer.</p>

<p>It’s important. Super important, in fact. Hard drives die all the time, and SSDs die, too; don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I back up my computer all the time to two locations: local and offsite. The former is in the form of a Time Machine I set up using an external HDD (3TB, USB 2.0). The latter is an offsite backup solution that send folders I choose to the cloud. </p>

<p>This cloud backup service is called CrashPlan. You might have heard of it, and if you have, that’s great. If you’re already a user, that’s even better. There are many cloud backup plans out there but this one I find is the best and the overall experience is outstanding, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Starting out, you get a free month to give it a shot. Signing up at CrashPlan.com requires zero payment, and if your free trial ends, you’re not on the hook for more months. The way the service keeps your membership up to date is through a serial number. You can purchase one or more licenses on the site, and plug them into computers where CrashPlan is installed. You don’t actually have to punch in your account information all the time in the CrashPlan app.</p>

<p>Backups occur in the background, out of sight. If you’re busy using your computer, it’ll backup at a slower and quieter pace. When you’re machine is idle, it’ll speed up, and spend more time working on your files.</p>

<p>One thing that sets CrashPlan apart is the fact that it can be used to backup your files to a local disk as well as another system on or offsite for free. The only thing you pay for is cloud. All files are encrypted before transmission and remain so when they land in the cloud. Only you can see the contents of a file and only your account and decrypt them. </p>

<p>Use a smartphone and access your files anywhere. Use another computer and download them from their Web site. Backup up to ten computers in your household for as low as $8.96 a month or get started with just a single computer for as low as $3.96 a month. Obviously the more machines your have and the farther ahead you pre-pay, the better your deal will be.</p>

<p>Give CrashPlan a shot. I love them. They’ve been running on my system for almost three years now and I haven’t had a single complaint. It’s a backup service I can set and forget and they’ve done a great job of staying out of the way while making sure the files I find most important are backed up on a regular basis.</p>

    <p>I caught an article this morning from <a href="http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a32668/invisible-girlfriend-experiment/">Esquire</a> talking about the writer’s experiences with <a href="http://invisiblegirlfriend.com">InvisibleGirlfriend.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter what I asked, Zoe always had a logical response. If she didn’t, she expertly skirted the question. Sometimes her texts were ominous, sometimes oddly detailed. She was always in a good mood. She didn’t mind if I ignored her for hours, though she always responded to me within minutes. She never texted first. If I didn’t initiate that day’s conversation, we simply didn’t talk.LOL… <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I kept reading the article and came to an odd conclusion: there really is something out there for everyone. At the same time, I became a little sad. The somethings out there for “everyone” include people behind a wall getting paid per text to have small talk with someone. Ten bucks says Zoe, the woman the author highlights in the article, looks nothing like her picture.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-02-16T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">16 Feb 2015</time>
    <p>It’s been roughly 40 days since I started writing on a continual basis. Some days have been more productive than others. There are days when all I manage to come up with are posts about other things going on in the world. I have enjoyed being able to just sit down and discuss what’s on my mind. When I sit down and talk about something that’s on my mind I end up writing a boat load of words. These <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill">two</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades">posts</a> are good examples. The first covered <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill">project management buzzwords</a> and the second covers a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades">god-awful movie</a>.</p>

<p>There is one thing I do more now than I ever did before. I think about what I want to talk about tomorrow. When something appears in my head I determine if it is good fodder for my blog. I don’t have a real direction for my blog just yet. This will change with time. For now I focus on writing and discussing topics I find important. I know someone out there will find them to be interesting. Perhaps they’ll share what they read with their friends. I won’t ever know if they don’t like them because I don’t use post comments. I decided comments were useless. They don’t contribute to my blogging experience in the least bit. </p>

<p>One more cool thing has happened. I didn’t use a comma in this whole post.</p>

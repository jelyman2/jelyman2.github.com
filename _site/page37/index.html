    <p><a href="http://noflyzone.org">This</a> is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/noflyzone-database-will-tell-drones-not-to-fly-over-your-house/">good news</a> for fans of privacy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday a new website and database launched called NoFlyZone.org, which invites people to enter their home address to prevent amateur drone pilots from zooming over their property, GoPro running. The database is maintained by a team of 10 people based in El Segundo, California, and led by Ben Marcus, a private pilot and drone operator.I have a pretty good idea what organizations won’t be using this database.</p>

        Kill Switch: Engage

    <p>One of the biggest “duh” technologies that we got in the last year or two was the phone kill switch. Lose your phone? Nuke it from orbit. Phone stolen? Nuke it from orbit. Jealous ex texting you at 3am? If you know their Apple ID password, nuke it from orbit.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0LF09520150211?irpc=932">Reuters</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thefts involving smartphones have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing “kill switches” that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen, authorities said on Tuesday.That’s great. Now if only there was some way to educate the remaining group of individuals responsible for stealing phones anyway.</p>

    <p>I read some powerful words, yesterday, and I knew right away they were worth discussing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you think, so shall you become. <br />
– UnknownIt’s powerful stuff but the words speak a simple message. We’re surrounded my many different influences that can shape our thoughts and actions, but the biggest influence is ourselves. We’re the ones that make the final decision on whether to act a certain way, and those decisions are based on the thoughts we have. Having a positive mind leads to leading a positive life, but one cannot have the latter without the former. It cannot be expected that by being negative and pessimistic on the inside will still allow for an upbeat life on the outside. Take care of yourself by taking care of where your head is at. It’s the first and biggest step to improving anything and everything else around you.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen such a great <a href="http://vimeo.com/118471437">story about a bridge</a>? Neither have I. At roughly ten minutes in length, Lightning Boy Studio comes at us with a great animated tale with no speaking on two men who were determined to fix or rebuild a bridge that had fallen away into a vast canyon. A couple years ago, this video was a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1662185920/le-gouffre-animated-short-film">Kickstarter campaign</a> that passed its goal by 5x. Let’s not forget there are a few feels, too.</p>

    <p>I use this playlist of tracks courtesy of Spotify exclusively for work. I try to not to mix my work and home playlists because they serve different purposes and I’m trying to keep them associated as such.</p>

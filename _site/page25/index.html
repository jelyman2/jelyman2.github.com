      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page25/" rel="bookmark" title="Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)">Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-01-13T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">13 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>This morning I ran out of coffee creamer so I hope this all makes sense, if not… meh. I’m just a week into my new weekday morning routine. If you’re unfamiliar or don’t remember how I described it, it’s simple.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to bed around the same time every night, with &lt;=30 minutes deviation.</li>
  <li>Set alarm for ~4 sleep cycles (~90 minutes each) + 20 minutes ahead of when I get into bed.</li>
  <li>Wake up within 30 minutes of alarm going off, allowing for a couple snoozes or time in bed with the light on to fully bring myself back to reality.</li>
  <li>Morning cleaning routine.</li>
  <li>Coffee. Must have coffee.</li>
  <li>Write. Unless something went sideways with the above steps, there should be time for this. If not, do something else stimulating enough to stay awake while consuming coffee.</li>
  <li>Proceed with the day.
That’s the idea. Yesterday was a bit rough as I woke up at a more in-opportune time and shut off my alarm. Since my travel to work was going to be different and more forgiving this week, getting up an hour and a half late wasn’t such a big deal. I don’t want to make it a practice though, as this is the whole habit I’m trying to break: getting up at the last minute and rushing.</li>
</ul>

<p>My old routine was chaotic because it left no time for deviation and frankly was frustrating. I had just enough time to do the bare minimum and that was it. No time to myself, whatsoever. After becoming more and more frustrated with it, I vowed to never do it again. I did some reading on how to “hack” my morning routine and while a load of it was crap or not useful in the least bit, the parts that stuck with me the most were about sleep cycles and morning stimulation.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-cycles">Sleep Cycles</h2>
<p>A human’s standard sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes in length, from stage one (light sleep) to stage four (heavy/REM/dream sleep). The idea is that if whatever wakes you up in the morning does so as you’re coming out of a sleep cycle and returning to light sleep, you’ll have an easier time waking up. For the most part, that seems to be pretty true. I’ve found it just as easy to wake up when my alarm goes off at 3:30am as it does at 5:00am (provided I went to bed at 9:00pm the night before). I usually grant myself four cycles for anytime I go to bed after 9:00pm and five cycles any time I go to bed between 8:00pm and 9:00pm.</p>

<p>But wait, you say… that’s only 60 minutes, a sleep cycle is 90 minutes! You’re right, it is. With the shorter cycle option, I find I have to give myself a bit of slack in the morning, by roughly 15-20 minutes. In this case, I’ll set three alarms, 15 minutes apart (ex. :00, :15, :30) and make each one more annoying than the one before it. See, I can sleep through a lot of noise in the morning hours once I’ve been through a sleep cycle or two. I’ve been tested and the doctors agreed. After one relaxes a bit in bed and has been sleeping for a bit, a lot of the stimulants and distractions from falling asleep are gone so submerging into deeper sleep is easier and more fulfilling. Thus, as deep as you go into REM sleep, it takes time to come out of it. Usually I’m aware it’s time to wake up when alarm three comes around because I seem to have trained myself to subconsciously understand that alarm one and two are warning shots that my warm, sleep-filled experience is about to end.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-part-of-waking-up-is-sometimes-not-folgers-in-your-cup">The Best Part of Waking Up, Is (Sometimes Not) Folgers In Your Cup.</h2>
<p>I find that most of my tiredness (or the feeling of being tired) seems to come from how and when I’m woken up in the morning in relation to my sleep cycle. I executed my five-cycle option last night and with ~7.5 hours of sleep, I feel rested. Of course, I’m wishing I had my coffee, and Starbucks will have to help me out as I drive into work this morning. A good morning stimulant isn’t always a bad thing. Some people can’t drink coffee because it’s too much caffeine and gives the anxiety or they don’t like the taste of it. I get it. I didn’t used to like coffee, either. I still don’t unless it has creamer.</p>

<p>One of my alternatives was Red Bull. I used to buy them by the case from a wholesale store (Costco). While roughly half the price per can as a convenience store or other local grocery chain, it was still Red Bull. It lost it’s luster after drinking one every day of the week, sometimes twice a day. Coffee is warm and creamy (after I add my creamer, of course). In the winter, this is an especially friendly feeling. In the summer, I’m more of an iced tea kind of guy. I’ll go Starbucks and get the largest, most caffeinated tea they have and have them sugar it up—I can’t stand unsweetened iced teas. Usually this is some kind of breakfast/black tea.</p>

<p>As I wrap this post up, I’m really wishing I wasn’t out of coffee creamer. A clear oversight on my part, I knew I was out when I poured, yesterday. I know I could drink it black, but I already said I don’t like the taste of black coffee. Perhaps I’ve been ruined by sweet tastes thanks to the likes of Starbucks and other espresso-shooting vendors. Maybe I have. Sue me. I’ll pay you in Starbucks cards, anyway.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-12T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">12 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>If you’re still with me, I’m on day eight of the <a href="/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a> challenge/workshop/event put on by <a href="http://john.do">John Saddingto</a>n of <a href="http://desk.pm" title="Desk.pm">Desk.pm</a> fame. He’s on year 14 of blogging so chances are he knows a thing or two. Today’s topic has to do with coming up with goals in relation to where I want my blogging to go using the S.M.A.R.T. principle. It is outlined like so:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific</strong> – target a specific area for improvement.</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable</strong> – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Assignable</strong> – specify who will do it.</li>
  <li><strong>Realistic</strong> – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-related</strong> – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
Those seem easy enough. When placed over the idea of writing, it seemed a bit daunting at first but that’s really only because I just started doing so consistently. Here’s a breakdown of how the above translates to me and the whole idea of writing and blogging:</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="specific-target-area">Specific Target Area</h2>
<p>I know I can produce quality writing if I just sit down and do it. I’ve never had a problem with that. I enjoy telling stupid stories, giving slightly janky points of view on seemingly random things, and also talking about real stuff that I find important. I don’t care so much if I’m maximizing my potential audience by covering as many topics as possible, because that’s my why I’m posting this—or anything—to my site. I need to focus on actually doing. I say I’ll become a master of X subject and never actually follow through with it. I’ll say I’ll go on more hikes next year because my gut says I could lose a few. I might not be able to control those things in this scenario. I can say this: if a bear craps in the woods, then I’m writing. I’m not talking about telling a story about a bear cutting pipe. I’m talking about the assurance that words will flow out of my mind, through my hands, into my keyboard, through the bits and digital stuff inside my computer, blah blah blah, to where you can see it.</p>

<p>TL;DR: WRITE.PERIOD.</p>

<h2 id="measurable-progress">Measurable Progress</h2>
<p>My first blog post since I started writing daily was on <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/73/ugg" title="Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?">January 6th, 2014</a>, which as I write this, was six days ago. It’s easy for me to say that since I’ve conquered seven days, including this post, without stopping, I could bust out a whole year. Whether or not that’s true, nobody will know, because I don’t feel like it’s realistic! I’m writing every day because I made a promise to myself that I’d do this challenge and see it through to completion. I never said “I’m going to write at least 365 blog posts over the course of the year, with at least one per day, or I’ll eat my hat.” That’s stupid. Unless I worked for a publication that required articles to be created in the turn-and-burn style, I’d get maybe a month into it and burn out.</p>

<p>I need to make myself a little bit more seriously and treat blogging and writing as a form of genuine expression. Because of my personality, if I’ve been talking <em>all day</em>, I tend to get bored of people and bored of talking. Just like talking, I’d get bored of writing. Why sit down at my computer and but out some words about something that I may care a grand total of zero percent about for twenty minutes when I could sit in front of my T.V. and not even have to think about using my brain. Exactly. That’s stupid. Even in school I enjoyed writing papers not because it was homework (that was quite foul), but that I was writing about a topic. I didn’t write every single damn day and I was alright with that. I hated the topic I was writing about, but I enjoyed the fact that I was writing about it.</p>

<p>Being able to split up my writing adventures to a couple times a week is much more manageable because I can spend more time, perhaps over a few days, and craft a more quality piece, than some lame three hundred words on how tasty Garlic Jim’s pizza is. (side note: it’s delicious.)</p>

<p>My measurement of progress is that I’m writing two to four pieces a calendar week, with two being the hard minimum. I need to still keep myself to a commitment, just like people commit to stop smoking. It’s hard to start, but with a hard limit like dying when it comes to smoking, having a hard limit on how few of times I sit down and put my thoughts on paper must be a thing, no matter what.</p>

<h2 id="assignable">Assignable</h2>
<p>If it’s not obvious by now, this goal is mine and mine alone. No one else needs to be responsible for my writing tasks, assignments, topics, or anything of the sort. This is my beast so let me conquer it. By making this a solo task, this is something I can wholly own and have zero fear of something outside that I cannot control mucking it up.</p>

<h2 id="realism">Realism</h2>
<p>Which brings me to this. As the popular saying goes: shit happens. It happened this morning when I twisted my ankle in the dark while walking the dog. Could I have done something about it? I don’t know, it was dark. I haven’t figured out how to turn on my night vision eyes, yet. With writing, sometimes life will get in the way and I’m completely OK with that. If I miss a week, then I’ll do my best to make up for it next week. If I know I’ll be missing a week in advance, I’ll put in extra time the previous week and schedule it out. WordPress has this fancy post-scheduling feature. While not as genuine and not as on-the-spot as some would like, I think I’m still totally genuine and real and on-the-spot. What I write down rarely gets condensed, censored, edited for time, etc. I just write. That’s always been one of my stronger traits when it came to writing; I hate outlines and I hate planning my words.</p>

<p>Secret: corporate, politically correct emails are the bane of my existence.</p>

<h2 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h2>
<p>I’m giving my self 1/4 year (13 weeks). If I can sit down and discuss quality topics with quality time at least twice a week, but no more than four, for 13 weeks, then I’m in business. If I make it, I’ll do it again, but add another stipulation. If I fail, I’ll pull back a bit. I think it’s doable. Given the possibility of the next six months to a year changing quite radically and a whole host of new experiences coming my way, I don’t think I’ll have an issue. I’m pretty confident I’ll have enough to talk about.</p>

    <p>I’m cheating a little bit.</p>

<p>See, I’m doing the <a href="/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a> challenge as a starting point to build up my blog, but after I started, I realized the last day of the challenge overlapped onto a day I’m taking vacation and probably won’t be writing much, at all. So I wrote this post, along with my day 6 post. Perhaps it’t not exactly cheating but I’d rather do two in one day than miss a day.</p>

<p>As I start building up this blog, one thing I want to keep track of is the content people enjoy the most and how long they enjoy it for before leaving. I’ve installed Google Analytics and am hoping I get some good data out of it.</p>

<p>This will also include links from social networks, as I am building them with the “utm” variables in the URLs so as to accurately determine via which method people are visiting the site and reading my content.</p>

<p>One thing I know may be surprising is what people find most interesting. Topics, stories, and ideas I like may not resonate as well with others and they might enjoy stuff I don’t cover as often. This is what the analytics should tell me.</p>

    <p>I was able to stick to my routine this morning and sat down to craft my About page. I’ve never really spent much time working on it so reflecting on who I am and how I got here was actually very helpful in deciding what to write and what to share. Looking back, I can’t really think of a good reason why I didn’t write one before, except for the idea that I just didn’t take it very seriously. 2015 is full of changes, including this one. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need some coffee!</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-10T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">10 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>Today marks my half-way point on my <a href="/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a> journey.</p>

<p>This site has served many purposes over the last couple of years, and none of them have really taken off. Looking back on how my routines have changed and what I am spending more time focusing on, I can really tell that at some point in the future that I can’t determine (yet), this site will finally become a permanent and consistent place for me to write and share my voice and thoughts.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve always thought about doing is starting a full-on tech blog, but the work involved is greater than the amount of time I have to spend, right now. I’m sure that’ll change in the future, and when it does, I’ll revisit the idea. In the mean time, I’m content with this one property.</p>

<p>While thinking about how my routines have changed, I know I still have a small struggle with the weekends. Over the last few days, I’ve been writing early in the morning before I leave for work and it’s been helping me start my day in a more gradual and stimulating fashion. The weekend is still a struggle though because subconsciously I know I don’t have anywhere to be in particular so why should I bother getting up early? Since hindsight is always 20/20, I can tell my 8 hour-past self that I wouldn’t feel like crap for sleeping 14 hours and my day wouldn’t be half-wasted away. I could have done a ton of stuff in the 5-7 hours I could have had as extra if I stuck to the routine I set up during the week.</p>

<p>With any new habit, it takes time to break out of the old one and build up a new one, so tomorrow is always another opportunity to try again.</p>

<p>One of my end goals with this blog is to be able to write about one particular complete topic related to the previous day. I know there are so many different things that happen all the time that I could have enough content for years, but a lot of it I don’t keep record of or even remember. I can’t remember where I read it but a statistic stated that we only remember roughly 6% of what happened the day before. Maybe that number is higher, but I also remember that within a week, that number drops to 1%. I know I can agree on the second number because this time last weekend, I remember very little of what I was doing…</p>

<p>I don’t want to just write about a random smattering of things, though. I want to keep it to topics I find interesting and relevant… stuff that describes myself and my interests, not just what I ate for breakfast, yesterday (oatmeal). It’ll take a bit of time to build up, but I’ll get there. Keeping my self writing everyday will help do that.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page25/" rel="bookmark" title="Finding a Short Domain Based on a Name is Harder Than Ever">Finding a Short Domain Based on a Name is Harder Than Ever</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-01-10T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">10 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>I’ve always really enjoyed having a short address to rely upon when I tell people where to find my sites. I’m personally of the idea that the shorter you can get your address and have it still make sense, the better, especially on mobile devices. Not everyone is willing to type in myreallycoolmobileapp.com when having appname.com is much better, or even app.co, if it’s available.</p>

<p>A lot of the two-letter TLDs belong to countries and some have rules or restrictions on who can register with them. The ones that don’t have rules or restrictions typically still charge an arm and a leg. For example, we all know the URL shortener bit.ly. Would you believe me if I told you that the .ly TLD goes for $150 for the first year on <a href="http://101domains.com">101domains.com</a>? Renewals are $230 for a single year. That’s a lot. There are TLDs that are much cheaper, like .co, .io, .is, .me, and whatnot, which is great!</p>

<p>Some however aren’t…</p>

<h3 id="the-differences">The Differences</h3>
<p>There are several acronyms for the various top-level domains you see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gTLD – Generic. (.com, .net, .org, .ws)</li>
  <li>ccTLD – Country Code. (.us, .uk, .ir, .br)</li>
  <li>IDN – Internationalized (.中国 / .xn–fiqs8s)
## The Struggle is Real
My problem is, however, that when I want to register a short domain that uses my name with a short TLD, I’m limited on options, unless I’d like it to make zero sense. My first name is Johnathan, and that right there is too long for my tastes (hence why I currently use <a href="https://jlyman.net">jlyman.net</a>; 6+3 is better than 9+3). I’d like to register a john.TLD domain but all the cheap ones are taken. Not surprising though, since John is an incredibly popular name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="varying-difficultly">Varying Difficult.ly</h2>
<p>With the proliferation of the Internet and everyone having an app, service, blog or portfolio, short addresses are harder to come by and the ones that are free will cost you. In the grand scheme of things, if I were to register a .ly address (for example), $150 a year isn’t too bad, and if I went straight to the source for the .ly TLD, I could save a lot of money. Finding “the source” wasn’t as easy as some are, however. With .ly, the country is Libya. Libya isn’t necessarily known for being the number one country for technological ease of use or freedoms. However, their NIC (Network Information Center) at <a href="http://nic.ly">nic.ly</a> provides a link to another site, <a href="http://ltt.ly">ltt.ly</a> (Libya Telecom and Technology), which gives a list of approved vendors of .ly domain names. On this list, is <a href="http://LibyanSpider.com">LibyanSpider.com</a>, a Libyan hosting and domain name registrar. They say I can register a .ly domain for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=40+LYD&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#rls=en&amp;q=40+LYD+to+USD">40 LYD</a>, but since I’m an international customer, I have to use <a href="http://Register.ly">Register.ly</a>. Now four levels in, I finally find a registrar that doesn’t charge as much as 101domains. At $75, while still a serious markup (one LYD is $0.84 as I’m writing this) over the 40 LYD ($33.48 USD), it’s about as good as I’m going to get. I can’t reasonably expect to get a foreign domain name that hasn’t been completely mainstreamed by the Internet for the price of a .com or .co.</p>

<h2 id="and-its-gone">.An(d) it’s gone.</h2>
<p>There are other registrar setups like this one out there for other countries, too. Some are harder to get into, like .an, which isn’t even available anymore, since the Netherlands Antilles dissolved in 2010 and became the distinct countries of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, along with three smaller still-Dutch-owned municipalities Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-just-fantasy">.is This Just Fantasy?</h2>
<p>The TLD .is is gaining in popularity, too, but isn’t dead easy (unless you want to pay the 101domains price). Iceland owns this TLD and can be registered directly via their NIC site at <a href="http://isnic.is">isnic.is</a>. At roughly $36 USD, it’s not a bad price, but their site isn’t very intuitive. Sometimes, paying a bit more makes the whole process that much easier.</p>

<p>I could go on for days talking about all the different gTLDs out there, but I think you’d have a lot more fun looking them all up yourself. Luckily, Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">has pretty much every TLD</a> out there in one list.</p>

<h2 id="new-gtlds">New gTLDs</h2>
<p>With the launch of newer topic-based gTLDs like .photos and .club, a lot of sites will eventually transfer over and older ccTLD and gTLD domains will <em>eventually</em> expire, unless a company chooses to keep renewing it and use it as a redirect. I’ve thought about having something like john.blog or jltech.blog, but I haven’t been able to make up my mind. There are a lot more options in the word-based TLD space.</p>

<p>I think this’ll forever be an ongoing battle. People with short names will always have the one-up on me.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">09 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>Every once in a while it’s a good idea to just take some time and reflect. As I sit here with my morning coffee, on my way to hardening my new morning routine (which I first described <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/143/space" title="The Space in Which I Craft">here</a>), I feel like the <a href="/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a> challenge I’ve taken on has helped me to try and get into a new way of starting my morning. For example, yesterday, I tried out new music playlists on my way into work. Since I ride the bus to work, keeping my mind stimulated during the monotony is important. I’m a huge fan of classical and acoustic music when the need to focus is important. Even now, I’m listening to the “ <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/0PRs1Xaui4zCv9LdIIt20X">Acoustic Concentration</a>” playlist on Spotify. But when it comes to my commute, it’s easy for me to get tired and want to take a nap (something I’m trying very hard to avoid) so I find playlists good for weight-lifting workouts and other high-energy music. Also, making sure I have my morning coffee is very important.</p>

<p>During my reflection, I’ve also been thinking about everything that I’m thankful for. My life has changed a lot in the last couple of years, and first and foremost I want to thank my wife for that. I first met her about three and a half years ago, and it’s been a crazy ride for sure, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. We got married February 2014 and I can’t see myself spending my life with anyone else. She’s always a comfort for me and being around her makes me feel so relaxed and happy. Second, I’m thankful for my parents. They’ve always supported me in anything I’ve wanted to do and are still always there whenever I need help. I try not to ask for help from my parents whenever I can avoid it because I feel at this point in my life, I should be self-sufficient; at the same time, however, I know that it’s not always a bad thing to admit you need an extra boost from someone. It may not be parents, but instead friends, or other relatives. Things happen, and it’s good to have a support system in place to help deal with life’s unexpected turns.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>That’s all I have to talk about, today. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <p>One thing I’ve come to learn is that having a good writing space is important. For some, the room has to be just right. Darkness, music, closed doors. For others, like myself, I don’t need as much. I think it’s worth breaking down to a more manageable conversation.</p>

<h2 id="lights">Lights</h2>
<p>Some folks like to keep the room dark, some like it brightly lit. I’m in between. I have a free-standing lamp from IKEA that uses two bulbs and the shades are a fogged white. The bulbs themselves are hybrid 75-watt-incandescent-20-watt-cfl. This allows the lamp to be immediately lit with bright, warm light from the incandescent bulbs while the CFLs are warming up. When they have, the bulbs automagically switch over and you notice little change. At first I thought this was awesome but I’ve come to find out that GE makes simple CFLs that don’t need any warming in 75w-equivalent sizes for roughly $7 bucks a piece. Future lights in that lamp will be of that variety, for sure. Until then, I’m content with my moderate lighting setup. It’s not too bright (like an office), which I hate, because I feel it’s distracting, and it’s not super dark, because that would put me to sleep. Plus, I feel staring at an LCD screen in the pitch dark is more traumatizing to my eyes than it’s worth, really.</p>

<h2 id="coffee">Coffee</h2>
<p>This is my first post in this challenge and on my blog in particular where I wrote it before 6AM. I decided yesterday to hack my morning routine and start getting up earlier, to the more natural rhythm of my sleep cycles. I’ve almost got it down, already, just need a few more tweaks. To assist in the morning energization of my mind, a nice hot cup of coffee from my no-fuss Keurig coffee maker is a must. I don’t have time to grind and crap.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I like listening to classical music while I’m at work. It keeps me in a calm state, so I figured I’d give it a try while writing. As I write this post, I’m listing to a rather even playlist of classical music deemed for concentration on Spotify, the best $10/month investment in the world. Seriously, if you’re not in the market to spend a ton on music (classical is super cheap, anyway, so perhaps you should just go buy a few compilation albums for a couple bucks each on Amazon), Spotify is the way to go. I have so much classical music in several locations: roughly 4 days worth, end-to-end, from Amazon Music, that I spent a grand total of $6 on, a few albums from iTunes, and a half-dozen playlists on Spotify.</p>

<h2 id="past-struggles">Past Struggles</h2>
<p>In the past, I’ve had bouts where I haven’t written in months, and this point of this exercise is to reflect on wether my environment is the reason for it. In my case, I’m pretty happy with where I’m sitting, in my 2nd-bedroom-turned-office. My struggle hasn’t really been with my environment, but more with my dedication to writing, and just doing it more. I get bored with things, easily, if I stop having motivation to do them, including writing. I’ve written several things in the past that I thought were really good but shortly thereafter, I stopped feeling like writing, in favor of doing other things.</p>

<p>This time around, writing will be a part of my daily routine, no matter what I haven’t quite figured out what time of day yet, as this morning I started this at 5AM, but yesterday I started at 5:30PM. I guess so long as I’m writing every day, I can hammer out the finer points of my routine as I find a rhythm that I like. Until then, I just need to keep putting words to paper.</p>

    <p>Part of this newfound journey I’m on to blog better is to look inward at myself and try to figure out why I write. It’s more difficult than it sounds because I feel I have two thoughts that form some sort of answer.</p>

<p><em>I have a thought, maybe two.</em></p>

<p>Sometimes there are topics and ideas that just sound interesting. Sometimes things are utterly stupid. Certain situations make stupid stuff interesting. I like to look at writing as me telling you what I think. By reading these words, you’re telling me you have at least a small interest in what I think.</p>

<h2 id="making-money-from-blogging-is-a-fine-line-to-walk">Making money from blogging is a fine line to walk.</h2>
<p>People don’t get rich off of blogging. People make money from ads. There’s a little part of me that hopes that some day I’ll strike it big, become famous, and my words will carry weight in the form of money bags, to the bank. I know this is a long shot and in the grand scheme of things, this is a terrible idea and hope to have as it might skew my writing. I want to be honest. Now that it’s out there, perhaps I’ll change my ways… only time will tell.</p>

<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have mashed potatoes calling my name…. get your own you damn dirty ape.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that someone can explain to me why in the literal hell I would think this is something I would wear.</p>

<p><strong><em>It’s just a Johnathan thing. You wouldn’t understand!</em></strong></p>

<p>Are you sure? At what point did I become such a pompous ass that everything I do, every action I take and word that comes out of my mouth raised to such a level that nobody on God’s green earth would understand it, even to a fraction of a degree? </p>

<p>At least they spelled my name right… spammers have a tendency to misspell my name at least a dozen times a day, according to my spam filter. Perhaps it’s time to make a new rule to filter out those who just don’t understand: If you email me, tweet me, or otherwise try to talk to me and you don’t spell my name right, I’m going to wear this god-forsaken sweatshirt, take a photo, send it to you, tell you go pound sand, and then run away laughing.</p>

<p>That sounds crazy, right? Well it’s a Johnathan thing… you wouldn’t understand.</p>

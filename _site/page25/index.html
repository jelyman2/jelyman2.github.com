    <p>Everyone has to start somewhere and there are great resources to help you do so. David Gewirtz writes on ZDNet on where to start and how much it might cost you. (Spoiler: not much).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this article, I’m going to take you through the steps you need to get an app up on the Android and Apple app stores. I’ll outline tools, resources, and steps you’ll need to take. I’ll even show you some tricks for building your own apps without any programming skill whatsoever.Check out the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-break-into-the-mobile-app-business-for-free-or-cheap-and-no-programming-skill/">rest of the article here</a>.</p>

    <p>And write what you don’t know in hopes that one day you’ll learn.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write what you know, write what you want to know more about. Write what you’re afraid to write about. – Cec MurphyThere are several topics I can think of off the top of my head that spark my curiosity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters, I’d like to learn more about app development. I have a grand idea (that I’ll share in a future post) that would make a dorky but amusing app. It wouldn’t make me any money, and that’s not the idea. The goal is to say I did it. Those are all awesome things to write about. One could create an entire blog about the process and have tens or hundreds of posts throughout the course of the project.</p>

<p>Exploration is another good one. I just finished listening to The Martian by Andy Weir and loved every minute of it. What I enjoyed most wasn’t the premise or how amusing the characters were, but the style of writing. (Spoilers, maybe) The main character is stuck on Mars, and a lot of the story is told from his point of view. The only way to do that while still keeping it somewhat realistic is by way of mission logs. Every day, Mark Watney logs his activities and his thoughts in hopes that someone will read or listen to them. Why not take a similar approach to a blog about traveling? Instead of recapping a course of events after the fact, write them down as they happen? Have a ton of little posts that go into detail. Pretend you’re alone on Mars, if you have to.</p>

<p>A third idea is to write about something you are frankly afraid to know more about. If you’re religious, write about science that defies your beliefs. Inversely, if you’re an atheist, do the opposite. If at some point it becomes uncomfortable, write about that, too. You don’t have to convert at the end, but at least give yourself an opportunity to see things from the other side. Don’t be close-minded. I know too many people who are and subsequently can’t have deep, ponderous conversations with them. That makes me sad.</p>

<p>At no point does any new thing you write about have to be permanent. Once you start writing about politics, you don’t have to keep it up. Just do it for an election season. If doesn’t have to be news reporting, either. Opinion pieces are all the rage and likely to be consumed more by those who share a similar opinion.</p>

<p>Think about what you’re writing. Is it challenging you in any way? If the answer’s ‘no,’ perhaps you’ve become too comfortable in what you write about. Personally, I try to write more about technical topics that are of interest but I’m not necessarily an expert because it also helps me think about them more. I get an opportunity to do research and gives me a good outlet to express my findings.</p>

<p>The next time you’re thinking about what to write, think about what you know nothing about. Think about something you don’t like. Think about something you know nothing about that you don’t like. You’ll find something juicy in there, I promise.</p>

        Remotely Working

    <time datetime="2015-03-12T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">12 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>With all the impressive technology we have today, one thing I’m surprised is still as ancient as it is is strict requirements on committing to an office every day to do work. There are a lot of jobs that don’t really require you to be in an expensive building. Off the top of my head, I can think of several jobs that would thrive remotely: software development, sales, support, devops, operations, accounting, and anything else where the majority of work is done on a computer. One can’t reasonably expect manufacturing to be done from home, but isn’t it all the same when you write code on your computer at work versus on your computer at home?</p>

<p>According to one guy, it’s not. In fact, he’s quite adamant that working remotely is detrimental to a company’s success. Someone should show him how well <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a> and <a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a> are doing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And my COO felt performance was slipping. Revenues were dipping by about $100,000 per month. While some people on our team do a great job no matter what, he felt others would benefit from closer supervision. At home, it’s easy to get distracted by tasks like feeding the dog or surfing the Web. Some team members’ performance evaluations were declining. Their follow-up on projects was sometimes slower than we wanted.<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102460256">[s]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that even a thing? Hiring quality people should include screening for poor work-from-home performance. The cool thing about working from home is that you can break up tasks throughout the the day and be able to do stuff like feeding the dog, something that takes a whole three minutes. Also… employees surf the web at work. People don’t need to wait until the get home to do that. Sorry, bud.</p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that someone could be so closed-minded in 2015. Actually, it’s not. Looking into the author, and reading some of the comments about him tells us he’s not even close to a good source of information on the subject. After I read the article, I pondered it for a bit. It felt so incredibly out of place. It was almost like something synthetic that was created for a specific purpose, and that purpose wasn’t to share genuine ideas. The article felt like it was written to prove a point to someone that the author’s idea was legitimate because without it, they would look like a fool.</p>

<p>Turning to the comments revealed all. I’ll let you read them for yourself if you’re interested.</p>

<p>Back to the original topic, though. If a company can figure out how to distribute itself in some capacity, cost savings could be had. The amount of necessary office space would shrink, salaries can flex based on the area the remote worker lives in (The media home price in San Francisco is almost five times that of Atlanta, for example).</p>

<p>All the while, without having to fork over extra money, the savings can be put to better use like higher quality medical benefits, more paid time off, and company outings or retreats. As much as I’d like to go into the numbers, I frankly don’t have the time or resources to do so. Fortunately for me, the <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home">Harvard Business Review</a> did the work, already.</p>

<p>The next time you’re job searching, think about working remotely. You might be surprised at what you could find. To get started here’s <a href="http://weworkremotely.com">a great site of remote jobs</a>.</p>

        DevOps

    <time datetime="2015-03-12T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">12 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>It’s not news anymore, but I thought it’d be worth mentioning real quick before I continue. I’m moving in the next couple months. In fact, as I write this, I have less than two months. The week of May 10th is when we’re slated to pack up our house and shift it south two states. That might not seem like a lot, but I’ve never lived outside of the Seattle area, let alone a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I just wanted to reflect for a minute on my job hunting.</p>

<p>There’s one thing that will always be in the back of my mind no matter where I’m looking for a job: competition. The economy is either doing well or poorly, depending on which political side you stand, but that doesn’t affect the number of people looking for a job. I’m specifically talking about the number of people looking for a a tech job, in a tech hub known as the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, there are a load of opportunities available, but there’s a trend with a lot of them: if you’re a college graduate who can program anything with your eyes closed, you’re hired. That’s what’s in nowadays. I’m not one of those people, and I’m ok with that. I don’t know if I’ll ever be a die-hard software developer. I like backends. I guess we can refer to that as DevOps, a term that until about 2010, was probably just made up mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>DevOps is a blend of software development and behind-the-scenes operations stuff. Think about the guys who make the internal tools in your company that allow you to do what you do. Those are DevOps guys. If you’re a software developer, think about the guys that made all the tools you use to validate, build, and test. In some shops, those are done in house… by the DevOps guys.</p>

<p>DevOps is a field that’s quite popular. You don’t have to be a wizard in a given language, but you need to know your stuff. There’s a lot of thinking on your feet and new challenges will always arise.</p>

<p>This is where I want to be. I have a really great idea in my mind on a platform that gives you the power of DevOps without needing a ton of staff and man hours to make your backend needs happen.</p>

<p>I hope to have something launched in the next five years. That’d be really exciting for me.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-11T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">11 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>I thought of a new way to spur creativity when writing. Carve out a chunk of time, and within that block you chose, write. No stops, no going back to link things, no erasing and starting over. Just write.</p>

<p>Sounds easy doesn’t it? No? It’s hard? Never. It’s only hard if you think you can’t do it. Remember the whole thing around failure I’ve been talking about? I’m pretty sure you’re psyching yourself out.</p>

<p>If you haven’t caught on yet, writing is a great way to get your ideas out, process your thoughts, and hash out any plans you might have. This means you could be writing something as simple as a set of instructions and only then would you realize that your process is flawed. If you hadn’t put those words down, would you have never known that you took the long way?</p>

<p>Get comfortable because we’re going to chat for a while.</p>

<p>2015 is turning out to be an interesting year. Of course we have the typical talking points like Obamacare, the Middle East, the economy, and what the NSA is hacking now. All of that stuff should pale in comparison to one thing: what are you doing for 2015?</p>

<p>I don’t mean what are your resolutions for 2015, I mean what are you <em>actually</em> doing? Your resolutions are likely just a bunch of crap anyway to make yourself feel better. What have you done so far to make <em>you</em> better?</p>

<p>Did you learn something new, yet? How about catching up on those books you’ve been meaning to read? (or listen to?) Did you finish that project that’s been sitting in your garage for the last three years? Your wife wants you to clean out the attic… did you find anything cool down there? Why haven’t you talked about it, yet?</p>

<p>I could go on and on and really end up rambling, especially since everything I’ve written so far has only taken five minutes to type out. If I’m going to stick to that 30 minute rule, we have a lot of talking to do.</p>

<p>I wonder what would happen if I told you that the thing you performed most poorly at today can be the one thing you end up being the best at? I’m serious. I don’t know how to fix a car, but because of my desire to tinker and fix computers, I’m positive I would end up being a master at it, even though cars have super advanced computers and other technical stuff.</p>

<p>While we’re at it, let’s promise each other to never use the word super, again. It’s tired.</p>

<p>I was pondering the effects of binge watching on modern television. It probably didn’t help that I was pondering this while watching House of Cards, binge style. I re-signed up for Netflix just to watch the show and plan on canceling once I’m done, effectively working itself out so I only pay $9 for season three. There isn’t a single retailer that would sell House of Cards, digital or otherwise, for $9. Isn’t that crazy? Same goes for what will soon be HBO Now. Think about it. You could binge-watch Game of Thrones, all four current seasons, in roughly a month if you really dedicated time to it, and only pay $15. How much would each season on disc cost? For a blu-ray, probably $50-70 per season. DVDs might be around $30-45 a season. iTunes? Likely $40 a season. Isn’t that whack?</p>

<p>What’s even worse is that people like me who get HBO at no additional charge with their cable subscription are essentially paying nothing for it. So far I’ve seen every episode of the first three seasons and haven’t paid a dime extra to do so. That’s the cheapest binge watching I’ve ever done.</p>

<p>I could probably also say a similar thing about Weeds when I used to have Showtime. I paid $0 for it, too, back in the day, and watched every episode. Crazy, right? I don’t own any of the seasons. I’ve never rented an episode. I paid zero dollars for it.</p>

<p>Now I know what you’re thinking, somebody did actually end up paying for it. You’re right. Comcast paid a fee for it. They took a hit because I got those channels for free—and in the car of HBO, I still do until August 2016—and there’s no such thing as a free lunch… but there is when I didn’t pay for it. It was free to me.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my next topic, 13 minutes in: free stuff.</p>

<p>We all like free stuff, don’t we. I sure do. Free services, free apps, free this and free that. I love food samples at Costco, BOGO sales… I could go on for a while. There’s something a lot of us forget, though. Free stuff comes with a price. You can get a free app on the App store, but more often than not, it’s probably showing ads. It might have been free for you, but the hours put into developing the app cost money. It cost time, resources, humans, food, you name it. None of that stuff was free.</p>

<p>If you have the opportunity to buy out the ads on an app so they don’t show again, you should do it. If you can’t afford the few dollars, you probably should be making cuts elsewhere, anyway. If you go to Starbucks and pay $5 for coffee every day, you can afford to buy an app. Plus it doesn’t hurt tom make your own coffee at home, anyway. Money saved all around!</p>

<p>Speaking of making coffee at home, I love and hate my Keurig. I love it because it’s simple. I hate it because it’s expensive. Coffee cups for it cost way more than they should and they know they can get away with selling such small servings of black gold for such a high price.</p>

<p>The problem is that I’m lazy. I could buy beans or pre-ground coffee in a bag and save a ton of money a year (probably literally) but that means I have to take the time to ground my own coffee and use the little filter adapter thing the coffee maker comes with. No it’s not hard… I’m lazy, remember?</p>

<p>Being lazy is a curse. It’s easy to be lazy if you’re use to it. Sometimes, you just don’t feel like doing a damn thing. I understand, there are days when I literally don’t do anything that doesn’t involve sleeping in a bed until noon on the weekends. After I get up, I quietly remind myself that I’m being lazy and I could have conquered just about everything on my todo list by that same time, but hindsight is 20/20 and blah blah blah.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about making a legit to-do list of things I need to take care of on a regular basis with one-time tasks included. For example, I need to wash my car, but I keep putting it off because there are a ton of other things I also want to do and I can do those other things at home. I’ve delegated myself to my house for weekend chores meanwhile other stuff outside the house becomes neglected… probably because I’m still being lazy.</p>

<p>This isn’t talk of someone turning pro. Remember those posts I wrote about that? I genuinely believe everything I said in each one of those posts, but to err is human. It’s easy to talk a big game about what we want to be. It takes a lot of work to actually get there. It also takes time. Time is money. Money is power. Turning pro is a powerful thing.</p>

<p>Have I rambled enough, yet? I’m closing in on thirty minutes and it’s quite amusing to see how my train of thought shifted from one set of tracks to another. This is how my brain operates on any given day. I’m not ADHD, I’m not all over the place, I just ponder a lot of stuff. Most of the time the marathon of morphing thoughts happen when sleeping is of utmost importance. It’s this non-stop thought box that sometimes makes it hard for me to actually come up with something to write about.</p>

<p>If I focus too hard on any one thing I thought about during the day, I forget all about it. I have to catch it in its transient state and make note of it without putting too much effort into it or it’ll vanish like a wisp of non-existent metaphors and descriptors never meant to be consumed and discussed.</p>

<p>Dang. Words. I wonder where they come from sometimes. I can go a whole day without saying a word to anybody with my mouth, but can put down thousands of words in text form. Sometimes I don’t feel like I have anything to say, but have a lot to talk about. I have a lot to express, but no words to share.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? In the end, I don’t really care. that’s not what this exercise was about. It was about just letting things flow from my mind, through my hands, into my keyboard, and onto this digital paper-blog-thing. These are the ways ideas form.</p>

<p>What starts as a ramble, ends in a story. What starts as an idea, becomes a masterpiece. Do you think Shakespeare was just sitting around taking a crap and all of a sudden the whole story of Romeo and Juliet just magically appeared in his head? I’d doubt that. Everyone has to start somewhere. I start by rambling.</p>

<p>I discussed several topics that by themselves seemed rather boring to me because I thought about them too much. I wanted to write a huge expose on binge watching on Netflix and the like but it just seemed dumb. Sure it’s a real thing and sure it’s worth talking about, but I’m not a journalist. I write because I can and because I want to, not because I have bills to pay. If I ever did that, I don’t know if my words would ever be genuine, again.</p>

<p>If I lost that element in my writing, I don’t think I’d ever want to do it again, in any form. The only form of expression I have that has never failed me nor has ever been anything but consistent in nature would be gone. I’m not sure what i’d do then…</p>

<p>Maybe paint?</p>

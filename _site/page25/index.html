        Finding a Short Domain Based on a Name is Harder Than Ever
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-10T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">10 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>I’ve always really enjoyed having a short address to rely upon when I tell people where to find my sites. I’m personally of the idea that the shorter you can get your address and have it still make sense, the better, especially on mobile devices. Not everyone is willing to type in myreallycoolmobileapp.com when having appname.com is much better, or even app.co, if it’s available.</p>

<p>A lot of the two-letter TLDs belong to countries and some have rules or restrictions on who can register with them. The ones that don’t have rules or restrictions typically still charge an arm and a leg. For example, we all know the URL shortener bit.ly. Would you believe me if I told you that the .ly TLD goes for $150 for the first year on <a href="http://101domains.com">101domains.com</a>? Renewals are $230 for a single year. That’s a lot. There are TLDs that are much cheaper, like .co, .io, .is, .me, and whatnot, which is great!</p>

<p>Some however aren’t…</p>

<h3 id="the-differences">The Differences</h3>
<p>There are several acronyms for the various top-level domains you see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gTLD – Generic. (.com, .net, .org, .ws)</li>
  <li>ccTLD – Country Code. (.us, .uk, .ir, .br)</li>
  <li>IDN – Internationalized (.中国 / .xn–fiqs8s)
## The Struggle is Real
My problem is, however, that when I want to register a short domain that uses my name with a short TLD, I’m limited on options, unless I’d like it to make zero sense. My first name is Johnathan, and that right there is too long for my tastes (hence why I currently use <a href="https://jlyman.net">jlyman.net</a>; 6+3 is better than 9+3). I’d like to register a john.TLD domain but all the cheap ones are taken. Not surprising though, since John is an incredibly popular name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="varying-difficultly">Varying Difficult.ly</h2>
<p>With the proliferation of the Internet and everyone having an app, service, blog or portfolio, short addresses are harder to come by and the ones that are free will cost you. In the grand scheme of things, if I were to register a .ly address (for example), $150 a year isn’t too bad, and if I went straight to the source for the .ly TLD, I could save a lot of money. Finding “the source” wasn’t as easy as some are, however. With .ly, the country is Libya. Libya isn’t necessarily known for being the number one country for technological ease of use or freedoms. However, their NIC (Network Information Center) at <a href="http://nic.ly">nic.ly</a> provides a link to another site, <a href="http://ltt.ly">ltt.ly</a> (Libya Telecom and Technology), which gives a list of approved vendors of .ly domain names. On this list, is <a href="http://LibyanSpider.com">LibyanSpider.com</a>, a Libyan hosting and domain name registrar. They say I can register a .ly domain for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=40+LYD&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#rls=en&amp;q=40+LYD+to+USD">40 LYD</a>, but since I’m an international customer, I have to use <a href="http://Register.ly">Register.ly</a>. Now four levels in, I finally find a registrar that doesn’t charge as much as 101domains. At $75, while still a serious markup (one LYD is $0.84 as I’m writing this) over the 40 LYD ($33.48 USD), it’s about as good as I’m going to get. I can’t reasonably expect to get a foreign domain name that hasn’t been completely mainstreamed by the Internet for the price of a .com or .co.</p>

<h2 id="and-its-gone">.An(d) it’s gone.</h2>
<p>There are other registrar setups like this one out there for other countries, too. Some are harder to get into, like .an, which isn’t even available anymore, since the Netherlands Antilles dissolved in 2010 and became the distinct countries of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, along with three smaller still-Dutch-owned municipalities Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-just-fantasy">.is This Just Fantasy?</h2>
<p>The TLD .is is gaining in popularity, too, but isn’t dead easy (unless you want to pay the 101domains price). Iceland owns this TLD and can be registered directly via their NIC site at <a href="http://isnic.is">isnic.is</a>. At roughly $36 USD, it’s not a bad price, but their site isn’t very intuitive. Sometimes, paying a bit more makes the whole process that much easier.</p>

<p>I could go on for days talking about all the different gTLDs out there, but I think you’d have a lot more fun looking them all up yourself. Luckily, Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">has pretty much every TLD</a> out there in one list.</p>

<h2 id="new-gtlds">New gTLDs</h2>
<p>With the launch of newer topic-based gTLDs like .photos and .club, a lot of sites will eventually transfer over and older ccTLD and gTLD domains will <em>eventually</em> expire, unless a company chooses to keep renewing it and use it as a redirect. I’ve thought about having something like john.blog or jltech.blog, but I haven’t been able to make up my mind. There are a lot more options in the word-based TLD space.</p>

<p>I think this’ll forever be an ongoing battle. People with short names will always have the one-up on me.</p>

        Reflection
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-09T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">09 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>Every once in a while it’s a good idea to just take some time and reflect. As I sit here with my morning coffee, on my way to hardening my new morning routine (which I first described <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/143/space" title="The Space in Which I Craft">here</a>), I feel like the <a href="/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a> challenge I’ve taken on has helped me to try and get into a new way of starting my morning. For example, yesterday, I tried out new music playlists on my way into work. Since I ride the bus to work, keeping my mind stimulated during the monotony is important. I’m a huge fan of classical and acoustic music when the need to focus is important. Even now, I’m listening to the “ <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/0PRs1Xaui4zCv9LdIIt20X">Acoustic Concentration</a>” playlist on Spotify. But when it comes to my commute, it’s easy for me to get tired and want to take a nap (something I’m trying very hard to avoid) so I find playlists good for weight-lifting workouts and other high-energy music. Also, making sure I have my morning coffee is very important.</p>

<p>During my reflection, I’ve also been thinking about everything that I’m thankful for. My life has changed a lot in the last couple of years, and first and foremost I want to thank my wife for that. I first met her about three and a half years ago, and it’s been a crazy ride for sure, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. We got married February 2014 and I can’t see myself spending my life with anyone else. She’s always a comfort for me and being around her makes me feel so relaxed and happy. Second, I’m thankful for my parents. They’ve always supported me in anything I’ve wanted to do and are still always there whenever I need help. I try not to ask for help from my parents whenever I can avoid it because I feel at this point in my life, I should be self-sufficient; at the same time, however, I know that it’s not always a bad thing to admit you need an extra boost from someone. It may not be parents, but instead friends, or other relatives. Things happen, and it’s good to have a support system in place to help deal with life’s unexpected turns.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>That’s all I have to talk about, today. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

        The Space in Which I Craft
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-08T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">08 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>One thing I’ve come to learn is that having a good writing space is important. For some, the room has to be just right. Darkness, music, closed doors. For others, like myself, I don’t need as much. I think it’s worth breaking down to a more manageable conversation.</p>

<h2 id="lights">Lights</h2>
<p>Some folks like to keep the room dark, some like it brightly lit. I’m in between. I have a free-standing lamp from IKEA that uses two bulbs and the shades are a fogged white. The bulbs themselves are hybrid 75-watt-incandescent-20-watt-cfl. This allows the lamp to be immediately lit with bright, warm light from the incandescent bulbs while the CFLs are warming up. When they have, the bulbs automagically switch over and you notice little change. At first I thought this was awesome but I’ve come to find out that GE makes simple CFLs that don’t need any warming in 75w-equivalent sizes for roughly $7 bucks a piece. Future lights in that lamp will be of that variety, for sure. Until then, I’m content with my moderate lighting setup. It’s not too bright (like an office), which I hate, because I feel it’s distracting, and it’s not super dark, because that would put me to sleep. Plus, I feel staring at an LCD screen in the pitch dark is more traumatizing to my eyes than it’s worth, really.</p>

<h2 id="coffee">Coffee</h2>
<p>This is my first post in this challenge and on my blog in particular where I wrote it before 6AM. I decided yesterday to hack my morning routine and start getting up earlier, to the more natural rhythm of my sleep cycles. I’ve almost got it down, already, just need a few more tweaks. To assist in the morning energization of my mind, a nice hot cup of coffee from my no-fuss Keurig coffee maker is a must. I don’t have time to grind and crap.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I like listening to classical music while I’m at work. It keeps me in a calm state, so I figured I’d give it a try while writing. As I write this post, I’m listing to a rather even playlist of classical music deemed for concentration on Spotify, the best $10/month investment in the world. Seriously, if you’re not in the market to spend a ton on music (classical is super cheap, anyway, so perhaps you should just go buy a few compilation albums for a couple bucks each on Amazon), Spotify is the way to go. I have so much classical music in several locations: roughly 4 days worth, end-to-end, from Amazon Music, that I spent a grand total of $6 on, a few albums from iTunes, and a half-dozen playlists on Spotify.</p>

<h2 id="past-struggles">Past Struggles</h2>
<p>In the past, I’ve had bouts where I haven’t written in months, and this point of this exercise is to reflect on wether my environment is the reason for it. In my case, I’m pretty happy with where I’m sitting, in my 2nd-bedroom-turned-office. My struggle hasn’t really been with my environment, but more with my dedication to writing, and just doing it more. I get bored with things, easily, if I stop having motivation to do them, including writing. I’ve written several things in the past that I thought were really good but shortly thereafter, I stopped feeling like writing, in favor of doing other things.</p>

<p>This time around, writing will be a part of my daily routine, no matter what I haven’t quite figured out what time of day yet, as this morning I started this at 5AM, but yesterday I started at 5:30PM. I guess so long as I’m writing every day, I can hammer out the finer points of my routine as I find a rhythm that I like. Until then, I just need to keep putting words to paper.</p>

        Why I Write

    <time datetime="2015-01-07T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>Part of this newfound journey I’m on to blog better is to look inward at myself and try to figure out why I write. It’s more difficult than it sounds because I feel I have two thoughts that form some sort of answer.</p>

<p><em>I have a thought, maybe two.</em></p>

<p>Sometimes there are topics and ideas that just sound interesting. Sometimes things are utterly stupid. Certain situations make stupid stuff interesting. I like to look at writing as me telling you what I think. By reading these words, you’re telling me you have at least a small interest in what I think.</p>

<h2 id="making-money-from-blogging-is-a-fine-line-to-walk">Making money from blogging is a fine line to walk.</h2>
<p>People don’t get rich off of blogging. People make money from ads. There’s a little part of me that hopes that some day I’ll strike it big, become famous, and my words will carry weight in the form of money bags, to the bank. I know this is a long shot and in the grand scheme of things, this is a terrible idea and hope to have as it might skew my writing. I want to be honest. Now that it’s out there, perhaps I’ll change my ways… only time will tell.</p>

<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have mashed potatoes calling my name…. get your own you damn dirty ape.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that someone can explain to me why in the literal hell I would think this is something I would wear.</p>

<p><strong><em>It’s just a Johnathan thing. You wouldn’t understand!</em></strong></p>

<p>Are you sure? At what point did I become such a pompous ass that everything I do, every action I take and word that comes out of my mouth raised to such a level that nobody on God’s green earth would understand it, even to a fraction of a degree? </p>

<p>At least they spelled my name right… spammers have a tendency to misspell my name at least a dozen times a day, according to my spam filter. Perhaps it’s time to make a new rule to filter out those who just don’t understand: If you email me, tweet me, or otherwise try to talk to me and you don’t spell my name right, I’m going to wear this god-forsaken sweatshirt, take a photo, send it to you, tell you go pound sand, and then run away laughing.</p>

<p>That sounds crazy, right? Well it’s a Johnathan thing… you wouldn’t understand.</p>

        Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-06T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">06 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>My wife told me something quite hilarious this afternoon. She said she saw a woman wear Ugg boots to an interview. Let’s stop and think about that for a moment… what is an interview, really? It’s one person asking another person questions. That seems simple enough, so who is she to judge if someone wants to wear a fashion item that was cool eight years ago to an interview? Maybe my wife was overdressed! Maybe the sky fell in somewhere and everything else this mystery lady could wear was crushed in an avalanche of space ions.</p>

<p>Then it got me thinking: we hear so much garbage on TV and the radio and read online about how today’s workforce just ain’t what it used to be. I’ll mostly agree with that statement, things have changed. There are fewer people in the active workforce then there was six years ago and I’m sure that’s a bad statistic for someone somewhere planning a political event. But perhaps we’re looking at this all wrong. We’re saying people are out of work because they suck at being relevant and nobody wants to hire them anymore, when in reality, they’re just wearing those damn awful boots with the fur to interviews. I’d be willing to bet the 1.5 bitcoin that Mt. Gox owes me that if fewer people wore boots to an interview (sans those above the arctic circle, they get a pass… it’s damn cold up there and that snow… oh God that snow) we’d have more people working! I have an idea.</p>

<p>Let’s take down the Ugg boot people. They’re the ones destroying America with their job-killing foot-holders! They’re so anti-American, they can’t even make a red, white, and blue colored boot! How dare they appease the socialists! Tools.</p>

<p>But wait… why stop at the boots? What about everything else!? We should ban computers because they don’t do enough to prevent spelling errors on resumes crafted by greasy teenagers in their parent’s basement. Those undiscovered wordsmiths are being held back by corporate America’s technological offerings. We need to bring back the #2 pencil… for America.</p>

<p>But wait… again! Can you imagine the horrors if their greasy car didn’t start? What would our new-found leader of the free world do if their 1993 Honda Civic didn’t start and they had to walk to work? If they lose their job, they’ll NEVER take over this country and bring it back to its full, Ugg-boot-free glory! We must stop the crap-mobiles from continuing their journeys on the road of freedom, aka America Avenue!</p>

<p>I have an idea… let’s let them wear the Ugg boots. Forget everything I just said. If you’re that much of a tool or generally ignorant that an interview for a professional job in a professional setting with other professionally-dressed people around you doesn’t give you a single hint that perhaps you should have worn something without the fur, maybe that job isn’t for you.</p>

        Disabling Comments on Existing Posts After Disabling Comments Site-Wide with WordPress

    <time datetime="2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">01 Jan 2015</time>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> I can’t seem to replicate this issue anymore and thus closed out the bug I submitted below.</p>

<p>I ran into an issue this morning after disabling comments site-wide on this particular site that I could no longer enable the Discussion widget to disable comments on existing posts. Since this seems like an issue others would run into, I took the liberty of <a href="http://link.jlyman.net/1xy9ztr" title="#30880 User Cannot Disable Comments on Existing Post after Disabling Comments Site-Wide - trac.wordpress.org">creating a bug against WordPress 4.1 addressing the issue</a>. If you’re interesting in following, feel free to do so here or via the bug itself.</p>

<h2 id="workaround">Workaround</h2>
<p>While clunky, my work around was to re-enable comments site-wide so as to have the Discussion widget return as an option in the Post Editor so I could disable comments for my existing posts. I cannot speak as to wether it was limited to just _published _posts as I did not test it.</p>

        Poor Planning on Your Part Does not Necessarily Constitute an Emergency on Mine
      </a>

    <time datetime="2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">01 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>While some would call him a tool, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Carter" title="Bob Carter">Bob Carter</a>‘s famous statement above rings truer than ever in my world. This post shall kick of a new series on project management faux pas. I’ll be tossing in my every so slightly jaded views and perhaps a rant or two where needed.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="a-fire-drill-is-an-emergency-preparedness-tool-not-a-pm-buzzword">A Fire Drill is an Emergency Preparedness Tool, Not A PM Buzzword</h2>
<p>There’s a boat load of buzzwords used in the corporate workplace that make me want to punch babies. I hear quite a few of them daily and it makes me glad I don’t have kids right now. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, good for you. You haven’t been tainted by middle-management’s eternal goals of making projects as convoluted as possible while wrapping them up with sleazy-marketing-colored paper and ribbon. It’s a common occurence to hear at least one of the well-known words or phrases on the list such as synergy, vertical, circle back, or the one I absolutely hate the most: <strong>fire drill</strong>. Any time someone says something’s a fire drill, I want to tell them “there’s no fire, go sit the fack down.”</p>

<p>Typically, Fire Drills are products of poor planning on someone’s part, and they’re trying to cover their own ass. Everything will subsequently be an emergency and whatever you’re doing, however important it may genuinely be, will no longer be of relevance. This makes the Project Management part of me absolutely rage with hatred so hot, the Seven Circles of Hell have seen nothing like it. The effect is compounded when you don’t have any visibility into the back story or even the entire project. This is where things can get ugly.</p>

<p>The takeaway here is this: do what you can with what you have, and that’s that. Don’t be afraid to say “no” because at some point, you as a project manager, lead, or other member of leadership in your team has to draw a line; your team is important and playing along with someone’s failure to execute will only harm your team more. When you do say “no,” also be prepared for an alternate solution. While you may want to just flip the bird and drop the mic, coherence between teams is crucial lest a company completely fall apart because teams are literally at war with each other.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-triage-a-last-minute-project">How to Triage a Last-Minute Project</h2>
<p>Here’s the scenario: you’ve arrived at the office at your normal time, and team lead Joe from the Development team at XYZ Corp (the company you work for) rushes to your desk and says they need all of your staff to drop whatever they’re doing and do A, B, and C tasks by the end of the day, then scurries back to whatever hole he came out of. You, the PM and leader of your team of elite superhumans, knows very well how quickly a project can go sideways and understands the need to make sure the pieces all fall into place in a timely fashion. Here’s where you have three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically say yes without any second thoughts.</li>
  <li>Say No with an asterisk (a.k.a: “I need more information”).</li>
  <li>Say No and give a reason.
Let’s cover those three options in detail and determine which will create what outcome, starting with the worst-possible choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="automatically-say-yes-without-any-second-thoughts">Automatically Say Yes Without Any Second Thoughts.</h3>
<p>Of the three, this is the worst idea and here’s why: you just arrived. You have no idea what the status of your own team, is, yet. How on God’s green earth can you assume you can pull a rabbit out of your hat if you don’t even know you have a hat? Your team may be okay with pivoting for a small period of time to assist, but don’t expect last-minute mandatory overtime to go over well. Your team members have lives outside of the company at which they work and other responsibilities. The work-life balance that’s been established already should be adhered to as much as possible. Those who can stay, will. Those who cannot, won’t. Accept that.</p>

<p>Be careful, though. If you press too hard or pull the last-minute card too often, you’ll start building resentment and once your team starts resenting you, either they’ll leave, or they’ll become bitter and cause more problems for you in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="say-no-and-give-a-reason">Say No and Give a Reason.</h3>
<p>This is a bit better of a choice, though not the best of the three for one good reason: your reasons may not be good enough for those above you. In some corporate structures, management doesn’t care that your team is already neck-deep in whatever projects they’re working on and can’t be pulled. Sometimes management does understand and accept that such is life. Joe, our friendly drive-by emergency crier won’t like it, for sure, but that’s not your problem. Setting boundaries is key to establishing proper inter-team relationships. It should be made clear who does what, who can cover for whom, what each team’s limits are, and the like. The last thing you need is to accept a last-minute project you can’t follow through on and end up causing more problems and setbacks and having management bear down on you even more than they already may be.</p>

<p>Your team will appreciate that you’re standing in front of them, taking the brunt of the force that is everyone else’s problems, especially if they’re already swamped and don’t have the resources to add more to their respective, metaphorical plates.</p>

<h3 id="say-no-with-an-asterisk-aka-i-need-more-information">Say No with an asterisk (a.k.a: “I need more information”).</h3>
<p>This option can be described as one where you’re basically saying “I need more information before I can make a decision.” This is the best of the three responses but not one others may necessarily like. While it will vary from company to company, some may expect a blind following and anything short of that is insubordination. Watch out for that. If you’re in that situation, you’re probably best getting out and finding a new gig. You don’t need that pressure on you at all times, it will wear you down.</p>

<p>When you basically say “wait a minute,” you’re telling them that you’re not opposed to helping, you just need to know the whole picture so you can make not only an informed decision, but make sure you can allot the resources necessary. This is where triaging of current tasks comes into play and it’s a learned skill. Make a thorough assessment of what’s currently going on in emergency land, then asess what’s going on in your own yard. Gather as much detail as you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The end goal?</li>
  <li>What phase(s) has/have already been completed?</li>
  <li>Remaining phase(s)?</li>
  <li>Why is this now an emergency?</li>
  <li>What can we do to prevent whatever happened from happening while we’re working to “put out the fire?”</li>
  <li>How many people are needed?</li>
  <li>What is the deadline?</li>
  <li>Why is that date the deadline?</li>
  <li>Are there alternate deadlines available?
While not every one of those items is rock hard crucial to helping complete a last-minute project, it’s important to be able to assess if the project converted to “last-minute” status because of some sort of blocking issue that needs addressing or someone dropped the ball. If it’s the former, then do what you have to do, soldier! Rescue and win the battle with glory and honor. If someone dropped the ball, you need to make sure you’re covered if you start assisting; the last think you need is to go down with a sinking ship that you don’t know is sinking. I’m not saying that you should automatically peace out if you find out that someone oopsed or neglected to do their part. I’m saying you need to cover yourself and your team before you go in. Don’t dive head first into a shallow pool.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can provide alternate solutions to the problem that is bringing with it buckets of doom, then go for it. It’s entirely possible someone missed something or has been neck-deep in whatever they’re struggling with and failed to see the solution from another angle. While nobody loves a pompous ass, everyone loves a hero, so go be that hero.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-the-options-make-things-worse">When All the Options Make Things Worse</h2>
<p>There’s an invisible line that once crossed, there’s no going back, and you’re better off elsewhere. You might find out that you crossed the line when you get let go because you chose the wrong option and now management wants your head because reasons (i.e. “corporate synergy”). Times like this suck and can be rather chaotic. The effects are longer lasting because it doesn’t just affect you in the short term, it affects those around you who may have depended on you, like your family. All of a sudden, the mortgage is on the line. It’s a tough line to walk and a lot of people aren’t willing to walk it so instead they choose to make whomever they have to happy no matter what the cost.</p>

<p>This is a decision you’ll have to make on your own. I can’t tell you what to do or what would be the best option. I can however tell you to be confident in whatever decision you make. Your team will look to your for guidance and if you’re not sure of anything, they won’t be sure of you. On the flip side, if you’re always willing to bow and kiss feet at the drop of a hat, your team will look at you as nothing more than a butt kisser. Don’t be that guy. I’ve seen a lot of that in my travels and my experience tells me that being a kissass is like doing heroin: once you start, it’ll be damn hard to stop. Not only that, but whomever’s metaphorical backside you’re planting your metaphorical lips on will get addicted to it, too. They’ll start to realize they can manipulate and basically come to expect that when they say “Jump!” you’ll say “How high?”, regardless if you’re already smacking your head on the ceiling just standing up straight.</p>

<p>Several militaries have a mantra called the “Seven Ps” (“7Ps”):</p>

<p>Piss</p>

<p>Poor</p>

<p>Planning</p>

<p>Promotes</p>

<p>Piss</p>

<p>Poor</p>

<p>Performance.</p>

<p>There are variations such as “Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance” and the six-word version “Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance” which is more along what I belive in on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<h2 id="dont-forget-youre-still-a-team-player">Don’t Forget, You’re Still a Team-Player</h2>
<p>It’s not a bad idea to understand that the nature of working with multiple teams is that from time to time you’ll have to step in. I want to make a disclaimer that all of what I said above should be taken with a grain of salt. A lot of it comes from personal experiences and trials and tribulations. I’ve been in the scenario of the Project Manager where I had to determine if my team really could help out or if I’m just going to send them to the butcher as well as being a member of a team where the PM blindly accepted all requests for emergency assistance that really wasn’t an emergency nor was it appropriate to drop everything and run into the burning building that was a very poorly planned project.</p>

<h3 id="another-disclaimer">Another Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Don’t get mad at me if you get fired over anything I’ve written. These are my opinions and you’re chosing to act on possibly unfounded information. If you value my opinion at all (which I think you do if you made it this far), be careful when sailing in uncharted waters. Don’t be a dick. Don’t get angry. Don’t ruin the vibe of the office, either. People will just hate you. Being professional is key to being respected. Even if you say no, a quality inter-team relationship will survive the decline or modification of a request.</p>

        I&#8217;m Completely Okay with Being Entrenched in the Apple Ecosystem
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">01 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>Typically when I wake up in the morning I don’t have many worthwhile thoughts until well into mid-morning (weekdays) or mid-day (weekends/holidays). Today was supposed to be the latter (New Years Day, a holiday for me) but when I woke up this morning, I realized something shortly after I (while still in bed) grabbed my iPad Mini and started checking emails: I’m deep in the Apple ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="the-mac-daddy">The Mac Daddy.</h2>
<p>Technically this isn’t a completely new revelation and not a statement of fact surrounding something that just happened overnight. I bought my first apple product in 2011 when I bought the Mid-2011 Macbook Pro 15″. While I had used Apple computers before (mostly the white, CRT and first LCD 27″ iMac), I wasn’t super familiar with them. What really convinced me to buy was my job at the time gave me a Mac to use as my daily workhorse (A 13″ Macbook Air) and I found my level of enjoyment increasing every day. I took it home for a while and played with it, doing personal stuff on it and just really enjoyed the experience.</p>

<p>I caved about a month later and bought my own Mac. This experience also included the initial sticker shock of spending $2300 (sales tax in Washington State was, at the time, 8.3%… ouch). I was quietly praying and hoping that this investment would last–I was totally right–and I wouldn’t regret it.</p>

<p>The time I spent with my work-issued Macbook Air gave me time to realize that the computer I use as my daily driver doesn’t need all the tweaking, customization, and granular control over its components like my at-the-time gaming desktop PC did. I couldn’t care less which brand of motherboard I had, nor if I had the maximum amount of RAM I could possibly stuff. I wanted a machine that I could fire up and have just work. I didn’t know this at the time but that idea would end up being my mantra for future device purchases to come.</p>

<h2 id="iphone-uphone-weallphone">iPhone, uPhone, weallPhone.</h2>
<p>Not more than a couple months later, my second step into the Apple pool came with the release of the iPhone 4S. I had already seen the iPhone 4 being used daily by several co-workers and they couldn’t stop drooling and chanting and raving about it. I bit the bullet, renewed my contract with Verzion Wireless, and a couple weeks later (a week earlier than my estimated delivery date), my shiny new phone arrived.</p>

<p>I was changing things up from the Motorola Droid X I previously owned. Before the X I had never owned a smartphone so I was still fairly green in the space. I didn’t quite know what to do first: do I listen to music? Do I watch something? I wonder how much of my iTunes library I can fit on this thing?</p>

<p>Making the move from Android to iOS was a bit jarring at first, but I can’t go without mentioning that the move was also bittersweet. I enjoyed the fact that I could practically do whatever the hell I wanted to my Droid X, but at the same time, I hated that. When I first made the transition, I switched back and forth a couple times just to make sure I really wanted to change mobile ecosystems. Every time I would go back to Android (version 2.2.3 was the latest version at the time for smartphones), I would find something else I hated-but-didn’t-know-it. First it was the battery life, then it was the lag, then it was lack of quality apps, then it was music management. All of these little things stacked up quickly and within just a couple of weeks, I had tossed my Droid X out for good. I never sold it. I just <em>threw it away</em> (read: recycled it) using the pre-paid package Verizon sent with my iPhone. I cared zero about getting any money out of it because I hated it that much at the end. I vowed to never buy an android device again (for a few years; more on that later.)</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward">Fast Forward.</h2>
<p>As the calendar peeled away, 2011 became 2012, 2012 became 2013, and all the while, I was happy as a clam with my iPhone 4S, then subsequently the iPhone 5. The taller screen was a good move by Apple, as it allowed for more vertical space for reading as well as more horizontal real estate to push those YouTube pixels in your face. The introduction of white wasn’t that bad, either–I bought it.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of 2013, though, a foreign player came into the game and toyed with my idea of what a great phone should be. This mystical beast of smartphone lore was the Samsung Galaxy S4.</p>

<h3 id="greener-grass-or-something-like-that">Greener Grass… or something like that.</h3>
<p>I liked the idea of the Galaxy S4. It was a bigger phone (5.0″ screen), 1080P resolution, thin almost to the point of anorexia, and lighter than helium, it seemed. It reeled me in with it’s flashiness and promises of being modern and able to help me get all my stuff done better than Apple ever could. Because I’m weak, I caved and bought it.</p>

<p>Let me save you the misery of hearing all about it and skip to the end of this side-story: I dumped it four months later. See, Android and the phones they run on are like conjoined twins: you can’t have one without the other. I enjoyed the hardware that made up the GS4, but hated Android. If I cut one half off, the other would be useless (a.k.a dead in my anatomy analogy). All the things I hated about Android were still true three years later: Even at version 4.0 or whatever the hell it was, music management was fragmented (Google Play Music barf), battery life sucked ( <strong>IDLING</strong> for six hours doesn’t constitute 80% usage of my battery) thanks to the ominous horse-shit that was the Google Services Framework that I couldn’t control, inability to control my apps and their desire to do whatever the hell they wanted whenever the hell they wanted with stuff like GPS, Bluetooth, etc. The <em>only</em> thing that seemed to improve was lag. Android was snappy in its UI, but also snappy like a real housewife of New Jersey. Once I realized nothing had ultimately changed, I couldn’t sell it fast enough. There’s some poor soul out there who traded me their iPhone 5 for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I hope they haven’t killed themselves because of how depressing Android makes people feel.</p>

<h2 id="tablets-an-interpretive-dance">Tablets. An Interpretive Dance.</h2>
<p>I still have that iPhone 5 roughly a year and change later, and will eventually invest in an iPhone 6 (or whatever is the latest and greatest when I decide to buy). For the holidays, though, my wife and I decided we needed a slightly larger format for mobile entertainment and have been thinking about tablets for some time. We (literally) instructed everyone to supply Apple Store gift cards as christmas gifts because we wanted iPads. That was it. Unless they felt so inclined to buy one outright, that was their only other option. Anything less was failure (not really). With a supply of gift cards in hand (12 to be exact), we hit up the Apple Store the day after Christmas (Boxing Day!) and aquired two of Apple’s finest iPad Minis.</p>

<p>My wife insisted on getting a gold tablet and while I tend to always want the latest version of whatever exists, I couldn’t validate spending +$100 on TouchID. Her case was valid, as the iPad Mini 2 doesn’t come in gold. I opted for the Space Gray and minus the TouchID, my Mini 2 is technically identical to the Mini 3 she purchased.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why I waited so long to purchase an iPad. It’s an amazing device that fits the mantra I operate by to this day when it comes to my daily-use home technology: it should just work. The level of craftsmanship is evident even more so in the apps released for it these days. I’m a huge fan of Blizzard’s Hearthstone and Super Evil Megacorp’s Vain Glory. I’m confident there would be some little thing that would screw up an otherwise good experience if I was to purchase an Android tablet.</p>

<h2 id="from-a-high-level-i-see">From a High Level I See.</h2>
<p>All of my communication devices are Apple products. I wrote this story on the same mac I bought in 2011 (which is still kicking serious ass to this day, totally justifying the purchase price), I interact on social media and play games with my iPad, and I listen to music and podcasts while I commute with my iPhone. Each device is similar yet serves different, defined purposes. I rarely play games on my iPhone or my Mac. When I do, it’s Dots 2 or Minecraft, respectively. I also don’t sit on Facebook or Twitter much on my Mac, while I do more so on my iDevices. I don’t listen to music on my iPad or my Mac because I don’t commute with those devices and commuting is the only time I really can tune out and enjoy music (I ride public transportation; tuning out while driving is dangerous, kids.)</p>

<p>This is an arrangement that I love and that works well for me. The Apple ecosystem has pulled me in (although I pretty much went willingly) and has crafted combined experiences for me that I find quite desireable. I don’t use iCloud for anything, though, so there’s that. I’ve had GMail since 2007 and changing email addresses is too much work when there’s no impending doom if I don’t.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>My current arrangement won’t likely change any time soon. I already learned my lesson when I tried to deviate from the plan of the Apple gods. They quietly warned me and I chose to ignore; I doubt I’ll be doing that again. I have zero prospects of purchasing or building a daily-usage Windows PC. If I choose to get back into PC gaming, I might visit it, but with whatever casual gaming I do being targeted towards the PlayStation, there’s little chance that idea will actually come to fruition as another tech product in my home. OS X has been and continues to be a great operating system to work with. I use Windows at work and while it definitely has familiarity on its side and can handle more businessy-corporatey stuff, I would hate to use it at home: too much disparity at this point. Windows Phone will never be an option for me: the ecosystem is barely alive as it is. Developers aren’t interested enough produce let alone maintain quality apps.</p>

<p>My tech nest is solid. I plan on keeping it that way.</p>

        Ten Dollar Taxidermy
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2014-10-19T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">19 Oct 2014</time>

    <p>I wanted so badly to be wrong…</p>

<p>But unfortunately I wasn’t. Apparently, the phrase ‘ten dollars’ lines up with ‘taxidermy’ more than I wanted. I’m an IT guy and a Photographer, what the hell do I know about taxidermy?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-taxidermy">What Is Taxidermy?</h3>
<p>Dead Animals. Scraped clean. Ever carved a pumpkin? Kinda like that. No sharpies, though.</p>

<figure id="attachment_102" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test.jpg"><img class="wp-image-102 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test-1024x832.jpg?resize=882%2C717" alt="Probably common taxidermy tools... who knows." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Probably common taxidermy tools… who knows.</figcaption></figure>
<p> </p>

<h3 id="here-kitty-kitty">Here Kitty Kitty…</h3>
<p>It’s probably not a coincidence that the idea of small animals having the contents of their body cavity evacuated like Chernobyl never to be occupied by substantial living things again comes up with my cat sitting next to me while I write this. While horrible on at least several different levels, I’d have a good moment of insane laughter if my wife came home to find the cat sitting on the couch as it is now, but staring with cold and soul-less marbles for eyes. Meow kitty kitty… not. Fluffy got stuffed.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ" />Sometimes the only way to find out if it’s dead is to poke it. I don’t suggest you use your hands, though. Those little fox things have some sharp teeth. Good taxidermy looks like the animal is still alive. While I’m not sure that’s for everyone; those who scare easily might want to stick to simple creatures that when you walk into a dark living room at 2AM, you don’t end up staining the carpet with your fecies. There might be an inherent “turd fee” involved for the more aggressive stuffed animals.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p> </p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1lzOD7faBv6kv9RkQXi3A2g-300x210.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*lzOD7faBv6kv9RkQXi3A2g" />Like in all professions, you end up working with someone who’s less than professional. In the case of Mr. Leopard to the left, I’m sure whomever worked on him was a true professional, and the owner of this taxidermous monument was quite excited when he got exactly what he asked for: “I need it to look like a weiner dog that got scared. Mmmk? Thanks!”</p>

<h3 id="the-what-the-f">The ‘What the F…’</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw" />It really didn’t take long to find a WTF example. I was expecting it to take at least three minutes to find an image that really portrays the message I’m trying to convey in this measly paragraph. Unfortunately, I was wrong… again. Sometimes I hate being wrong. I really do. I also wish that sometimes I would hope for the inverse of what I really want so when my new expectations are met, I can feel better about myself. Anti-drinking prevention tip #28.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And now… let’s weave the writing prompt in just a touch more.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-i-get-for-ten-dollars">What Can I Get for Ten Dollars?</h3>
<p>That’s actually a lot harder of a question to answer than I originally thought. Doing a few Google searches in my underwear really only amounts to the most archaic form of finding information with the least amount of effort involved but we’re not all meant to have our noses shoved into books like Charlie Sheen shoved his nose into his… not books… made of powder.</p>

<p>Turns out I had to broaden my horizons a bit, which, while it broadens the idea of ‘taxidermy’ in this discussion, it’s all I can come up with and damn it I have to be right. I’m telling you this story exactly how I want it to be known so deal with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ-1024x589.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="Need some new champers? For $4, you can have three sets of teeth! Hell to the mother loving yeah! http://ebay.com" /></a></p>

<p>Coyote teeth make great party gifts and door prizes. The cost to enter said door in the first place however is a twisted sense of humor and the willingness to embrace whatever is on the other side. For parties that involve coyote teeth, I doubt there’ll be anything warm and welcoming. It’s probably one of the minor circles of hell, actually. But if you’re into that sort of thing…</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw-1024x588.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="1*siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw" /></a></p>

<p>You might as well take it all the way. Whatever floats your boat and rids you of that burning sensation in your pocket… which if you’re buying the above, I doubt it was money that’s been burning you all this time. I fear that you’re not meant to be holding a cross… I think you’re alergic to it.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-how-did-confusion">What the… How Did… [confusion]?</h3>
<p>I put up a question on Facebook Friday evening asking for a topic to write about. I didn’t give requirements, boundaries, or suggestions. I just ended the sentence and waited. My call was answered. Combined with Medium’s writing prompt about something related to $10 and my question on Facebook, this sounds like a great way to kill a few hours on a Saturday evening! There’s nothing like sparking the creative spirit with a completely random topic with a random modifier. I have zero interest in taxidermy but it’s quite interesting to see what kind of… eh… stuff people put up for sale. In the case of taxidermy, it’s interesting, bothersome, disturbing, and plain gross sometimes. There are loads of things I can’t unsee and will likely give me nightmares. Oh well. The cost of doing business, I guess.</p>

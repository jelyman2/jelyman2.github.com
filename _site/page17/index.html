    <time datetime="2015-02-23T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</time>
    <p>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EMXBDMA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EMXBDMA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=EJPMID7W3G3C7TOR">The Martian by Andy Weir</a> lately, and while not a long book, it’s deep. The story follows Mark Watney, one of the first people to step foot on Mars. He also might be one of the first to die on Mars, too…</p>

<p>As I reflect on this story, I can’t help but wonder what it would be like to be alone on Mars, or anywhere for that matter, for an extended period of time. </p>

<p>Think about it for a second:</p>

<p>There’s nothing.</p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>Nada.</p>

<p>Your only friend is dirty mars dirt.</p>

<p>Nothing to do.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>But wait, maybe there is something to do, something to keep your mind occupied. Maybe there’s something to be had out of nothing or very little.</p>

<p>Just like Watney in The Martian, at times we find ourselves in similar situations, in less than ideal circumstances. Sometimes, we’re down to pretty much nothing (read: ramen). It can feel like all hope is lost and there’s no point in continuing to go on. No one is coming to save you and no one is even noticing you’re in a void.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/quitting">talked about having a good support system</a> before, and I’ll mentioned it again. Having good friends and family, even if only a few, around you to keep pushing when it doesn’t seem like there’s a reason is critical. </p>

<p>Imagine where we’d all be if nobody supported each other and we were left to fend for ourselves. No camaraderie, no friendship, no push to do better (or just do). Life would be utterly dismal and meaningless. We give meaning to live and meaning to those living life by supporting one another, even it’ll be a long time before help arrives. Sometimes one needs to duct tape life’s pieces back together to keep them in place in the short term. No one said it had to be permanent.</p>

    <p>Settling for a ‘meh’ lifestyle leads to nothing more than ‘meh’ everywhere else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was in deadly earnest and committed 100% to making my life as an over-the-road trucker. What I was really doing was running away…It’s easy to get into a rut and stick to a routine that involves mediocrity. Sometimes it’s easy. Easy work can also pay well, too. In Pressfield’s case, driving a truck and traveling around the country. Sure that sounds cool, but is that what turning pro means? For some, sure. Some people genuinely enjoy truck driving and that’s their career. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your world, what are you doing to contribute to your purpose? What is it that you want to do with your life? Is what you’re doing now contributing to that? Unless it’s hobby related, that answer should be yes.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=BNM2PMM3XHDP636W">Pressfield</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We pursue callings that take us nowhere and permit ourselves to be controlled by compulsions that we cannot understand (or are not aware of) and whose outcomes serve only to keep us caged, unconscious and going nowhere.Are you addicted to living a ‘meh’ life? While such things are inherently less dangerous than an addition to a hard drug, addicts all have similar descriptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the lies, the evasions, the transparent self-justifications and self-exonerations. But the addict himself is often a colorful and fascinating person.There’s a layer of crap on top of a great wealth of awesomeness. Even with living life, it’s easy to become addicted to the security blanket or comfort zone one builds around themselves. It’s easy to stay within those bounds and do nothing more than what’s necessary to keep that wall up. Distractions are made and deviations happen often so as to keep the momentum of boring going and to keep the unknown from catching up.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The amateur is an egotist. He takes the material of his personal pain and uses it to draw attention to himself. He creates a “life,” a “character,” a “personality.”Also known as: “<em>woe is me.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s easy for me to tell you to stand up and face the fear of the unknown and put down the metaphoric needle of habitual boringness. In reality it’s not. Without confidence to try something new or finally take that first step to becoming pro at life or at what you want to do, fear, self-doubt, and self-sabotage will take over.</p>

<p>What can be done about that? A support system is a great start. If you’ve never climbed a mountain before, doing it alone isn’t a good idea. If you’ve never stepped out into the unknown before, having someone or a group of people to help you wherever they can makes it easier. Have friends hold you accountable. Have your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend, sister, brother or other relative check in on you every day and talk about how it’s all going. However this support system helps, never ignore it and never push back when you hate what it has to say.</p>

        Giving Up is Easy

    <time datetime="2015-02-21T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">21 Feb 2015</time>
    <p>The easiest way out of a difficult situation in life is to give up or pull the pin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=BNM2PMM3XHDP636W">Pressfield</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term “pulling the pin” comes from the old days of riding the rails. To uncouple one car from another, the train crew pulled a heavy steel pin out of the coupling mechanism.When someone pulls the pin in a metaphorical sense, they’re giving up, they’re quitting. I’ve been in situations where I wanted to give up so bad. There were times that I did, too! Hell, I’ve given up a lot in my life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes when I gave up, it was because I made a made decision in the first place. Sometimes, it was because I didn’t give a rat’s ass, and sometimes, I was bailing.</p>

<p>No one is immune to giving up because it’s easier. Looking back on things I gave up on, if I stuck with them, I could be in a different place than I am today. Instead, I have to live with my choices, and those choices ultimately gave me the great things I have today… with a bunch of additional hard work.</p>

<p>I can speculate that I might not have the job I have today, I might not have the wife I have today, and I might not be living where I am today. Who really knows? If I hadn’t given up high school, I could have gone to a good college and had a degree in something I enjoy several years ago. Looking at my age, I would also likely have a master’s degree, all before I turned 26.</p>

<p>I pulled the pin and paid the consequences for it. I failed out of high school and had to start over in order to graduate. I had to work jobs that didn’t require much education in order to make a living. I led a shadow life not doing what I really wanted to do because I fucked up. Even during this shadow period, I never pulled the pin, and it’s paying off.</p>

<p>Would I go back and do it differently? Hell yeah I would, so long as I can pick and choose what happens. Unfortunately, that’s not how life works, so without that control, I absolutely wouldn’t go back.</p>

<p>The next time you think about pilling the pin or giving up, think about what’ll happen next. Think about more than just your feelings at that moment. Stop being selfish. I was selfish and only cared about my laziness. I cared only about how easy the easy way out was. Life isn’t easy. To think it is, is amateurish in nature and a guaranteed way to fail.</p>

<p>I’ve seen what it’s like to not give up.</p>

<p>I’m not a fucking quitter. Fuck pulling pins.</p>

    <p>What do you think about when I say the words “you’re an amateur at living life?”</p>

<p>Think about that for a moment. </p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=YQM2YDP3UUCJ7UF6">Pressfield</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we hate our lives and ourselves, two models present themselves as modes of salvation.The first is the therapeutic model. In the therapeutic model, we are told (or we tell ourselves ) that we are “sick.” What ails us is a “ <strong>condition</strong> ” or a “ <strong>disease</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second way is the moralistic model. The moralistic model is about good and evil. The reason we are unhappy, we are told (or tell ourselves) is that we have done something “ <strong>wrong</strong>.” We have committed a “crime” or a “sin.”</p>

<p>We’ve established two potential outcomes for how we’ll treat ourselves if we’re not where we want to be in life or aren’t good at something we wish we were good at. That sound like a pretty noob way of thinking. The ultimate goal should be not to knock down but to hack and slash the crap away. In turn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We find our will and our voice and we find our self-respect. We become who we always were but had, until then, been afraid to embrace and to live out.That’s the end goal but it won’t happen overnight.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took me a long time to come to terms with the idea that I had ambition. I felt guilty about it. Who was I to aspire to “rise above” my brothers and sisters or to aim to be “better” than anybody else?The words of a quitter… are you a quitter? I sure as shit am not. There are days when I feel like I should just give up but I never do because that’s me looking for an easy way out and not finding one. There’s never an easy way out of life. This includes suicide. That’s not an easy way out. There’s nothing easy about leaving your friends, family, and the world behind forever. There’s no such thing as a random act of suicide. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest driver of turning pro is ambition. Without it, failure is imminent. </p>

        Fake SSL: Another Reason to Own a Mac

    <p>I’m almost positive I’ll receive flack for this from people who think I’m talking out my ass, and that’s fine. Recently, it has come to light that certain model Lenovo laptops were shipping with what most would chalk up to nothing more than adware, a.k.a Superfish. For a few months at the end of 2014, consumer grade Lenovo laptops received this software that hijacks web browsing sessions ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a> included) and injecting them with ads it feels you’ll appreciate.</p>

<p>By that description, about every adware out there is on the same level, and probably is viewed all the same by Lenovo. Curious enough, this software wasn’t ever present on any business-class laptop or desktop like the ThinkPad or X1.</p>

<p>This type of attack is what’s referred to as a MITM or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man-in-the-Middle</a> attack. It sits quietly between you and whatever your destination is on the web and picks out and replaces bits as it sees fit. In this case, these bits were ads. Typically this isn’t easily done, if at all, with secured traffic (identified with <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://</code> in the address) but Superfish took it one step further, and packaged their adware with an additional root certificate that masquerades as being owned by whichever secure site you visit. A typical user probably wouldn’t ever notice this as their browser would show the site is secure and the certificate is for said site. A few seconds of clicking around would reveal that certificate isn’t actually owned by the site (or company) being visited, exposing the catastrophic problem.</p>

<p>What makes this even worse is Lenovo claims they though their users would <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-honestly-thought-youd-enjoy-that-superfish-https-spyware/">enjoy it</a>. I don’t have much else to say surrounding that. It seems pretty self-explanatory that Lenovo’s consumer division is an idiot.</p>

<p>Some more technically inclined people would catch on to this right away and make the necessary changes to pull the root CA and be on their merry way. Others would wipe their system and install Windows fresh from the get-go without any of the bloatware or extra crap to this day still ships on some consumer PCs.</p>

<p>_ <strong>Pro Tip</strong> : If you want a retail machine that doesn’t ship with shit, buy a business desktop or laptop. You’ll have a much better time._</p>

<p>If you’re interested in knowing more about wiping your PC the easy way or cleaning it up without all the hassle, Paul Thurrott has <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/tag/clean-pc">great articles on his site</a> for doing that.</p>

<p>If you’re more adventurous, you could wipe the root CA away yourself with some help from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-to-remove-the-superfish-malware-what-lenovo-doesnt-tell-you/">this article</a> by Ars Technica.</p>

<p>Windows Defender has new functionality to clean out this adware, as highlighted by Microsoft, so <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/windows-defender-now-removes-superfish-malware-if-youre-lucky/">running it might also solve your problems</a>, if you’re one of the few users running one of these systems.</p>

<p>But let’s talk about my original statement in the title of this post. This wouldn’t have ever happened on a Mac. I know I say crap like that all the time, and while it’s true, I understand how it can sound douchey. Too bad I don’t care. One of the many reasons I bought a mac was for security. I know that computers are inherently safer if people aren’t attacking them but with the market share in the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/07/mac-achieves-highest-u-s-pc-market-share-ever-in-q3-2014-according-to-idc/">double digits</a> now, an attacker could still stand to gain a bit from Mac users.</p>

<p>Windows PCs have been plagued with pre-loaded crap for years. Back in the mid-2000s, they came with a literal boat load of freeware, shareware, trial software, and other adrific crap no one wanted. It was how the PCs became so cheap after a time. Today, they’re still cheap, and like the above scenario, <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/174587/refreshing-your-pc-wont-help-why-bloatware-is-still-a-problem-on-windows-8/">still holding crap nobody wants</a>.</p>

<p>Something Apple does will is keep a tight grip on the shipping product. There aren’t companies stuffing their crap into Apple systems of any kind so Apple <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/163303/how-computer-manufacturers-are-paid-to-make-your-laptop-worse/">can make an additional few dollars and random companies can do the same</a>. The out-of-the-box experience has always been a big deal for Apple and while us Mac users might be paying a premium, we’re also being spared from massive security holes and the like created by third parties and purposely installed by our computer manufacturer.</p>

<p>I’m not going to try and deny fake SSL certificates can’t appear on a Mac. It’s possible, for sure. The key here is Apple doesn’t ship with them.</p>

<p>Microsoft claims to be doing some good work in this area with their Signature Edition PCs you’ll probably only find in Microsoft Stores. It’s a bit cheesy but their site describes <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store?SiteID=msusa&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;Action=ContentTheme&amp;pbPage=MicrosoftSignature&amp;ThemeID=33363200">how much faster your new Windows PC can be</a> if you bought it from Microsoft instead of that cheap ass PC OEM. You know it’s a sad day when Microsoft is taking advantage of the situations their own OEMs have created (the same ones that buy Windows OEM licenses from them) in order to make some extra cash. It’s pretty much a double-dip on Microsoft’s part and they’re enjoying it, I’m sure.</p>

<p>While I write this on my Mac, let’s not forget not every manufacturer does this. Be sure they’re being watched even closer now by security experts who are waiting for the day the next batch of PCs comes out with vulnerability-laden crap.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re interested: Superfish has gone silent. I guess they won’t be needing those new iOS developers they’re hiring for, after all.</p>

  <p>I didn’t talk to anybody during my year of turning pro. I didn’t hang out. I just worked. I had a book in mind and I had decided I would finish it or kill myself. I could not run away again, or let people down again, or let myself down again. This was it, <strong>do or die</strong>.While maybe a tad extreme, it has an extremely powerful point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At what point do we nut up or shut up? Shit or get off the pot? If we can’t take the heat, we get out of the kitchen. All these metaphors mean the same thing, as you see just above in deliciously bold characters:  <strong>do or die</strong>.</p>

<p>When in a scenario where I have to think about the fact that if I don’t do something, a metric ton of consequences will follow, I think about one thing: why the hell am I pondering not doing and instead considering dying? I’m not literally dying in these situations, but I might as well be killing my goals and dreams.</p>

<p>I’ve pondered a lot about the idea that choosing to not do something equates to taking two steps back and every positive move is just one step forward. It’s easy to get lost in the weeds.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even doing doesn’t pan out. Spending all that time on that thing yielded zero other things. What was the point? Sticking to it and giving 100% is the point. That’s how you become a pro.</p>

<p>These are things I think about. Why am I in the job I’m in? Because it’s the next step. Why does it suck? Because I decided it sucks.</p>

<p>I’ve been pondering my career more and more as I approach May. If you haven’t been following along a lot or ever, really, I’m moving out of state in May for the foreseeable future. At least seven to ten years of my life will be in another state, doing other things. It’s up to me to make those things as kickass and valuable as possible. I either do, or I die.</p>

    <p>Social media is all around us at this point. It’s hard to avoid a conversation or an interaction with someone without it involving some sort of social media communication. One could argue that it’s the more current version of email, text messaging, and letter writing of days, decades, and centuries past, sure. I’m not entirely sure where I stand on it. I enjoy checking things out on Facebook, I <a href="http://instagram.com/jlymanphoto">post my photography</a> to Instagram, I <a href="http://twitter.com/theejl">tweet</a>… but I enjoy a good face-to-face conversation, too… </p>

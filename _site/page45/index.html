        Hunting the Hunter: Trying to Take a Photo of my Cat
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>I tried something interesting, yesterday. Every once in a while, I find the urge to pull out my camera and shoot stuff at home. It doesn’t happen very often, and for good reason. My space is outside, where things don’t move, where all I have to worry about is what time the sun sets, and how cold my fingers will end up at the end. The outdoors is peaceful. Nature doesn’t have a schedule and it largely sticks around for as long as it deems necessary. There are great places to hike, camp, and smell the roses, if there are any. </p>

<p>Bringing it back into reality, however, my home isn’t anything like that. </p>

<p>Have you ever tried taking a photo of you cat?</p>

<p>I did, and it wasn’t easy. It took a bit of thinking, stealth maneuvering, and patience. See, cats are these interesting creatures that do whatever the heck they want, when they want. They’re the part of nature that waits for no one, and if you miss out, that sucks for you. It’s interesting to see the juxtaposition of an animal that’s an extension of our larger feline friends in the wild, so free-spirited, and they end up pooping in some baking-soda-covered clay chunks, and they’re totally ok with it. </p>

<p>Maybe your cat’s chill. Good for you. Maybe you don’t own a cat and think I’m totally whack even talking about it, not long after talking about my cat being in a box. You might be wondering if I’ve run out of ideas of things to write about. All of those thoughts are valid and I understand your concern. I’m not crazy, though. Never the crazy cat person, will I be.</p>

<p>Oh, and you might be wondering if I ever got that photo?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Cat 1. Human 0.</p>

        On the Bus in the Fog Unlike a Dog on a Log in a Bog with Nog
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>This is the first time I’ve tried to write a post on the bus. There’s a lot of free time to be had on the bus, that I could just waste reading ArsTechnica articles or scrolling Facebook. But after my recap on the finicky <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/268/give-it-up">relationship I have with my iPhone</a> I feel like it’s necessary to look into putting it to better use.</p>

<p>First off, let me be clear. I don’t have any special writing apps to craft posts for when I’m in a bus in the fog writing for my blog (or any other alliterative, Dr. Seuss-type wordplays). I’m using the basic Notes app that comes with all Apple devices these days. I’m not even bothering to check my spelling too much as autocorrect seems to be doing a pretty good job on its own. Now granted if my word choice ends up being a total crapfest, then I feel like I need to go back and update it.</p>

<p>Along with the Notes app comes the <a href="http://WordPress by Automattic https://appsto.re/us/i9Mau.i">WordPress app from Automattic</a>. It’s how I interface with my site from both my iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p>Second, I don’t find it necessary to spend every waking moment writing, although it is enjoyable. I’m sure if I tried hard enough I could find enough stuff to talk about during the day to write non stop for two people.</p>

<p>Third, what’s a blog post anyway but a digital journal entry? All I’m doing is putting my thoughts on digital paper and sharing them. I understand the recourse of the idea that once it’s on the Internet it’s there forever.</p>

<p>At some point, someone will want to sit next to me and hopefully I’ll be close to the end. There’s nothing I hate more than someone peeking over my shoulder trying to see what I’m up to. I get passing glances and whatnot, stuff happens. I can’t expect someone to never catch a glance of my kickass high score in Candy Crush.</p>

<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to clear my autocorrect dictionary after all the new crap words it seems to have recorded after I wrote this.</p>

<p>PS: I might have seemed a bit ramble. That’s just how I write and think on a moments notice. I wrote this post more so to prove a point that to myself that I can write wherever I am. In the future, I think I’ll have to procure one of those keyboard iPad cases. A small screen makes my thumbs hurt.</p>

        The Workforce in 2030

    <time datetime="2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</time>

    <iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ux1GxExRUUY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I recently caught a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux1GxExRUUY">TED Talk by Rainer Strack</a> on the shifting of the workforce in the few decades to come. There’s a fundamental change that’ll take place soon and one thing’s for sure, there’ll end up being a lot more vacancies in the job market than there are now. I’m sure you’re wondering: [Conservative] How can this be? Isn’t the economy in the toilet, still? [Progressive] How can this be? Isn’t the economy doing great already? Well fear not pundit! Because neither really matter. See, it’s not about how the economy’s doing but who’s working. In the 50s, we had what you’d call a “boom.” It wasn’t an industrial boom, nor an oil boom. It was a baby boom. While it sounds all fine and dandy, the problem lies in what will happen when that sharp population growth that took place fifty and almost sixty years ago all of a sudden decides to retire. I’m sure you can figure out the rest.</p>

        Never Gonna Give You Up, Never Gonna Put You Down&#8230; Sometimes.

    <time datetime="2015-01-25T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">25 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>As much as I try to stay current with technology, there’s a part of me that just doesn’t care if I check my phone all the time, or am constantly reading emails on the weekend. I know a lot of people keep up to date on the latest everything with every device they have and that’s awesome. I just can’t do that. However, there’s one device that I really can’t live without because it’s become a gateway to the “Quick-Check-to-See-if-the-World-Has-Burned-Down” reality: my iPhone.</p>

<p>I’m quite sure the list of people that say they couldn’t live without their phone is staggering. Hell, Instagram is a phone-only thing and look at how many people share what they’re eating on regular basis! If people stopped caring so much about their phones and making sure everything that was going on was going through their phone, Instagram would shut down. It’s likely that twitter would take a big hit, too. Facebook… meh. People are still butthurt about the unbundling of services that Facebook did recently, because they don’t have anything else to be upset about. They’re rebelling against the system by using their browser or their computer as if that’ll do anything. You go guys… way to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love having my phone around with me all the time, but it’s more of a just-in-case-something-happens kind of need. I might be listening to podcasts while I travel to and from work every day, but we’ve been able to do that for quite some time, before smartphones were a thing (remember the iPod?) so that doesn’t count as a dire need. I listen to music, too, but that also falls under what I just described. I might check twitter every now and then or watch Facebook all morning but that just drains me. Have you ever sat on twitter reading people’s 140-character-or-less thoughts and NOT felt drained or depressed afterwards? The world sucks nuts and I can only read about it for a little bit.</p>

<p>The world used to be a simpler place. Cats used to sit inside cannons like it’s no big deal. You can tell a lot about a time period by whether you have a cat that’s willing to loiter around artillery. Those days were nice.</p>

<figure id="attachment_267" style="width: 629px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tumblr_neyf5bef5V1sfie3io1_1280.jpg"><img class="wp-image-267 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tumblr_neyf5bef5V1sfie3io1_1280-1024x642.jpg?resize=629%2C394" alt="tumblr_neyf5bef5V1sfie3io1_1280.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">See!? A Cat. In a Cannon. What, did you think I made that up?</figcaption></figure>
<p> </p>

<p>For all I don’t use my iPhone for, though, if I didn’t have it with me, I’d feel disconnected, I’ll admit. It’s become more of a security blanket when I’m moving between point A and point B. I, and likely society as a whole, have been trained to think that if I leave my house without my phone, something bad might happen and I won’t be able to call for help! I wonder how people in the 90s even survived.</p>

<p>I think if I absolutely had to, could resort to a dumb phone. Apple still makes iPods, so all my smart tools could just migrate to that device. I’d have iMessage wherever I had wifi and text messaging on my dumb phone. Turns out, though, that I’d still end up paying an arm and a leg for service. The difference of $20 for data isn’t worth the downgrade. On the flip side, the uncharge of $20 for data to have a smartphone is paltry.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day I’ll see if I can go a whole day without my smartphone. I have a ton of technology around me at home, and a ton more at work, so really there’ll only be roughly three hours out of the day where I’m in that disconnected state that won’t allow me to get the latest tweets that I hate or read emails the bleeding freaking second they arrive.</p>

<p>But that’s unlikely.</p>

        A Recap of the #10DaysBetterBlog Challenge
      </a>

    <time datetime="2015-01-25T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">25 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>I finished the Ten Days to a Better Blog (a.k.a. #10DaysBetterBlog) challenge a couple weeks ago and ever since, I just can’t stop writing! I knew I had it in me, but it took signing up for something and actually committing to it in order for me to realize I could actually find the time to put words down and express what’s in my head.</p>

<p>So as a kind recap from the posts from a couple weeks ago, here’s the ten days, broken down by day. If you’d rather see them all listed out as posts, you can do so  <a href="/c/10daysbetterblog">here</a>…</p>

<p>Day 1:  <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=73&amp;action=edit" title="Edit “Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?”">Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?<br />

</a></p>

<p>One thing I’ve come to learn is that having a good writing space is important.</p>

<p>Day 4:  <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=150&amp;action=edit" title="Edit “Reflection”">Reflection<br />
</a></p>

<p>Every once in a while it’s a good idea to just take some time and reflect.</p>

<p>Day 5: <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/163/half" title="Half-Way There">Half-Way There</a></p>

<p>Today marks my half-way point on my  <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a> journey.</p>

<p>If you’re still with me, I’m on day eight of the  <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog">#10DaysBetterBlog</a>challenge/workshop/event put on by  <a href="http://john.do/">John Saddingto</a>n of  <a href="http://desk.pm/" title="Desk.pm">Desk.pm</a> fame.</p>

<p>Day 9:  <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/209/coffee" title="Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)">Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)</a></p>

<p>This morning I ran out of coffee creamer so I hope this all makes sense, if not… meh.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-11T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">11 Oct 2015</time>
    <p>Every time we meet or communicate with someone, be it face to face, over the phone (who does that anymore), text message, email, Skype, etc., we have a fresh opportunity to make the best of the situation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/">High Existence</a> has a great <a href="http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/">article</a> listing 25 “ <a href="http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/">life hacks</a>” to make the most of social situations. Number eight is key for me. I’m terrible at remembering names. Number 12 is so true, too.</p>

<p>The key in all this isn’t to necessarily dominate in a conversation, but to use certain things, triggers, the environment, and each others strengths and weaknesses to your advantage.</p>

<p>I’ll admit there are quite a few in this article that I could learn and use in my own life.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Have I not destroyed my enemy when I have made him into my friend? ~ Abraham Lincoln</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So often we spend all of our time trying to literally destroy our enemies and fail to understand that while it may feel good in the short term to have conquered someone with negativity, we’re just terrible people.</p>

<p>It’s easy to say that while not in the heat of the moment, and sure, words slip from time to time. The point is that using words to put someone down—accidentally or otherwise—didn’t just happen by chance.</p>

<p>Instead of using all this energy to bring someone down to your level or below, why not lift them up? There may be a reason why you dislike an individual today, but that reason may not exist for ever.</p>

<p>There are actions that once committed lead to irreversable consiquences, and in those cases, it’s wise to just move on without that person in or around your life.</p>

<p>For everyone else, you might be surprised how easy it is to defeat your enemies by becoming friends with them. You might find that whatever was bothering you about them wasn’t actually that bad, after all.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-10T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">10 Oct 2015</time>
    <p>Going to keep this one simple: I wish High School had prepared me for real life. High School never taught me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Real money management</li>
  <li>Taxes</li>
  <li>Real job search skills</li>
  <li>Computer engineering</li>
  <li>Neutral views on social issues
You know what I did learn? A lot about the past. It seemed like every class taught me stuff that people discovered a long time ago, but not how it was relevant to the present day. Homer wrote some books and some mathematical equations were discovered quite some time ago, but how can I apply this to real life, the life that’s in the present?</li>
</ul>

<p>When I find out, I’ll tell you, because high school didn’t.</p>

<p><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ScreenShot2015-10-10at12.05.52PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://xqsuperschool.org">XQ, The Super School Project</a> aims to reinvent the high school and make it something that can acutally teach kids what’s relevant for today’s world. We’re not just talking about stuff like how to program. Learning [subject] is important, but not in the context of memorization and anecdotal fact memorization (the current method); [subject] is important in the context of how it can be applied today, right now. What about Greek Mythology can I use right now, to do something or make an advancement in my career or society?</p>

<p>Also a good question.</p>

    <p>In just a week, we pack up and head south. When we moved to the Bay Area, we needed a place to land in short notice. Now, we’re “moving up” in terms of location. Looking forward to being so close to some of the greatest tech companies.</p>

    <p>I’ve started learning Ruby on Rails. One thing I want for myself in the next year or so is to do more software development. As an added bonus, if my career shifted into that type of work, I wouldn’t mind.</p>

<p>I chose Rails because of it’s completeness. It’s not just a language—ruby is the language. It’s a complete framework for building any kind of web app you can think of.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas on web apps I want to build and some of them could turn into real things that could make money. In order to be able to do that, though, I have to have a platform to build upon. I think Rails is it.</p>

    <p>I’m sitting here, looking at my computer screen, and am mesmerized by the desktop background. I feel like I need to be there, instead. Then I wonder… why aren’t I? The trip is only a few hours from the Bay Area to Yosemite and El Capitan, the land structure off of which the latest version of Apple’s Mac OS X is based.</p>

<p>I haven’t gone on enough adventures this year. This last year so far has been crazy. Moving from one end of the left coast to the other took a latent toll on everything. Adjusting has taken some time. I know I used to write a lot more than I do now. I used to have a routine. Now, things just kind of happen.</p>

<p>It’s only October, though. I still have almost three months left in this year to do something and there is always next year, too. New Year’s Resolutions are for chumps, though. If I make any plans, I’m just going to do them. I don’t need some special ritual to convince me I need to do X.</p>

    <p>It’s been hard watching interested parties inquire about my now-retired Macbook Pro. It may just be a computer, but that computer got me through numerious job searches, it travelled a thousand miles, lived in eight homes, and more.</p>

<p>I never thought I’d end up being so sentimental about it. I bought this computer before I met my wife, even. It just goes to show how fast time flies.</p>

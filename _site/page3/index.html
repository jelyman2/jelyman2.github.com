    <p>In just a week, we pack up and head south. When we moved to the Bay Area, we needed a place to land in short notice. Now, we’re “moving up” in terms of location. Looking forward to being so close to some of the greatest tech companies.</p>

    <p>I’ve started learning Ruby on Rails. One thing I want for myself in the next year or so is to do more software development. As an added bonus, if my career shifted into that type of work, I wouldn’t mind.</p>

<p>I chose Rails because of it’s completeness. It’s not just a language—ruby is the language. It’s a complete framework for building any kind of web app you can think of.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas on web apps I want to build and some of them could turn into real things that could make money. In order to be able to do that, though, I have to have a platform to build upon. I think Rails is it.</p>

    <p>I’m sitting here, looking at my computer screen, and am mesmerized by the desktop background. I feel like I need to be there, instead. Then I wonder… why aren’t I? The trip is only a few hours from the Bay Area to Yosemite and El Capitan, the land structure off of which the latest version of Apple’s Mac OS X is based.</p>

<p>I haven’t gone on enough adventures this year. This last year so far has been crazy. Moving from one end of the left coast to the other took a latent toll on everything. Adjusting has taken some time. I know I used to write a lot more than I do now. I used to have a routine. Now, things just kind of happen.</p>

<p>It’s only October, though. I still have almost three months left in this year to do something and there is always next year, too. New Year’s Resolutions are for chumps, though. If I make any plans, I’m just going to do them. I don’t need some special ritual to convince me I need to do X.</p>

    <p>It’s been hard watching interested parties inquire about my now-retired Macbook Pro. It may just be a computer, but that computer got me through numerious job searches, it travelled a thousand miles, lived in eight homes, and more.</p>

<p>I never thought I’d end up being so sentimental about it. I bought this computer before I met my wife, even. It just goes to show how fast time flies.</p>

    <p>So I received my new Macbook Pro, today, thanks to the wonderful folks at UPS. It’s in my hands now and I’m super excited. I’ve only spent about 20 minutes with it so far and here are a few things that stand out to me from the start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When spinning up FileFault encryption from the initial setup screen, expect the mac to get warm.</li>
  <li>Inital estimation on how long FileVault would take was six days.</li>
  <li>I LOLed.</li>
  <li>One cannot upgrade to El Capitan without FileVault complete. This cannot be stopped mid-process, ergo:</li>
  <li>One should not enable FileVault from the start if they plan on upgrading directly to El Capitan.</li>
  <li>N00b.</li>
  <li>That Screen.</li>
  <li>That read/write speed.</li>
  <li>The power cord is much easier to dislodge than the older pre-retina Macbook Pros. This is something I will have to get used to.</li>
  <li>Not having a 2nd spinning drive makes this system near silent. I can’t really hear it, now, even though it’s a small furnace at the moment with all the disk I/O.
That’s all that jumped out at me right away. When File Vault is done, I’ll follow up with disk benchmarks. I’m looking forward to seeing how wide that canyon is.</li>
</ul>

    <p>This is something I’ve been waiting to see for a long time. As you’re aware, I’ve been using a four year old Macbook Pro for quite some time (placed the order in June 2011) and today I’ve finally made the upgrade to a 2015 of the same make and model.</p>

<p>The one thing I was excited to see the most above all else is the disk I/O speeds.</p>

<p>Let’s compare…</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-02-16.42.35.png"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-02-16.42.35.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-10-02 16.42.35" /><br />
</a></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-02-at-4.40.41-PM-952x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-10-02 at 4.40.41 PM" /></p>

<p>Big difference, eh? The former is a SATA 6Gb SSD (Toshiba 128GB) and the latter is a PCI-e SSD (256GB). My how times change.</p>

    <p>We’re going to see <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_martian/">The Martian</a> tomorrow evening. I’m super stoked. I consumed the audiobook via <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Martian-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG">Audible</a> about eight months ago and have wished for a movie ever since.</p>

<p>My only complaint: it’s not in <a href="http://imax.com">IMAX</a>. Space movies need IMAX. C’mon Ridley Scott.</p>

    <p>I was combing Rotten Tomatoes’ reviews of The Martian, and one popped out at me as one of those reviews that make it seem like the reviewer didn’t actually watch the movie and or didn’t know there was a book…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2015/10/walk-visual-magic-one-few-films-which-3d-justified">Ryan Gibley</a> from <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2015/10/walk-visual-magic-one-few-films-which-3d-justified">The Statesman</a> said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the while, he is keeping a video diary in which he is sassy (“In your face, Neil Armstrong!”) as he outlines every step of his plan to make contact with Planet Earth. It’s almost as if he knows he’s a character in a movie.What?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone who read the book, I can tell you Matt Damon’s character, Mark Watney, is like this in the book, too.</p>

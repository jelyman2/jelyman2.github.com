        Making it to 100

    <p>Today is the 55th day of the year, and I’ve made it to 100. I’m not quite sure what the rest of the year holds. As I sit here with my coffee  like I do most mornings, I’m thinking about my <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog">first real stent</a> at blogging, the <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/smart">first goals I set</a> for myself, and when <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/for-february">I changed up those goals</a> shortly after because I ended up blowing through them.</p>

<p>March is coming around soon, so it’ll be time to make slight adjustments, as always. I’m excited for the next 100 posts. Let’s see what happens!</p>

  <p>The sure sign of an amateur is he has a million plans and they all start tomorrow.What plans start today?</p>

<p>I’m guilty of this. The idea of ‘why do today what you can put off until tomorrow.’ It’s a terrible way to think and it leads to more procrastination. </p>

<p>My struggle with this rears its ugly head even more now as I’m simultaneously going to school, doing job training, and searching for a new job in a place I’ve never really been to (outside of a few hours). I definitely don’t have the advantage of being local. I also don’t have the advantage of being a brain child or software development prodigy so in an area where not only tech jobs are a dime a dozen, but people to fill them are a nickel a dozen, my work is cut out for me. </p>

<p>I’m not saying it’s impossible: leads are starting to trickle in. I’m saying it’s an uphill battle and because I still have time, it’s easy for me to say I’ll work on it tomorrow, or this weekend. Turns out I don’t have that much time. A couple months and change isn’t much time and I have a hard deadline to meet. I have a backup plan but even that’s not a for sure.</p>

<p>With so much riding on this, it’s not something I can hold off doing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find three hobbies you love: one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, and one to be creative.Bonus points if you have one über-hobby that gets you all three. In my case, photography is that hobby. I’m not quite covered on #1 and #2, but  it’ll take time. No hobby is a money printer or ass kicker overnight (unless you print money while standing on one leg holding a medicine ball and painting at the same time). </p>

        CodeAcademy &#8211; The Basics of Code in One Hour

    <p>One thing I’m working on is improving my software development skills. In 2015, along with everything else, I want to be much better at programming and development. One tool I used when I first started, and revisited again last night, was <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-code-hour/id762950096?mt=8">CodeAcademy on the iPad</a>. A great app that teaches you the super basics so other languages don’t seem so daunting. It’s free, and anyone can use it. Give it a whirl and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-code-hour/id762950096?mt=8">download it from the App Store</a>. I mentioned it was free, right?</p>

<p>When you’re done, visit their <a href="http://codeacademy.com">full site</a> and start learning more advanced stuff. If you’re totally new to coding, start with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">HTML</a>. In this day and age, it never hurts to know it. If you’ve already been through all of their stuff and want more, check out the post I wrote not too long ago listing other great sources for learning to code. </p>

        Shadow of Mordor &#8211; a.k.a Shadow of Difficult Awesomeness

    <time datetime="2015-02-08T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">08 Feb 2015</time>

    <p>I don’t play many videos games at the same time for one reason: I don’t have time. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy playing video games as much as the next mid-20s male. When I do have time to play a game, it has to be some thing I really want to play and play actively.</p>

<p>This is where I picked up Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. This is one of those games where I looked at it for some time and never bit the bullet but then one day my wife gifts it to me.</p>

<p>I started playing it yesterday, and am playing it as I write this and one thing jumped out right away: it’s hard.</p>

<p>And by hard I mean: I died a lot. The game itself isn’t very hard. It’s actually about on par with what I would expect for this style of gameplay. The problem lies from the idea that one can fire up the game and start slaughtering the world around them, and that’s definitely not true. The missions are in place for a reason: complete them. If you don’t, you’ll likely be missing out on some cool powers and upgrades that’ll keep you from dying so much later on.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MiddleEarthShadowofMordorFirst30MinutesGameplay-42.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once I realized that, I started mastering the art of slaughtering orcs and boy is it fun. As the story progresses, you start climbing the ranks of orcs and knocking them down, one by one. Don’t lose to them too often, though, as they’ll become more powerful and bring more friends with them, making them hard to beat.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ejrbrg5ciei5kyolvltw2.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you set your sights on a target, you want to do everything you can to take them down right way. Don’t half-ass your assassination attempt and be really good at countering attacks. They’ll knock you down and put you on your back in no time and before you know, you’ll be respawning. Learn each captain’s vulnerabilities, it’ll make life much easier for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shadow-mordor-review-12.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Beyond that, have fun. I really enjoy the game now that I know how to play it. Because I know how to play it, it’ll take longer to finish and grant me more reward for completing the smaller things, giving me that ever so needed satisfaction of progression and completion.</p>

        Financial Planning and Investment Apps that Don&#8217;t Suck
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-02-07T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">07 Feb 2015</time>

    <p>I’m always looking for a new tool, app or service that can give me a leg up when it comes to investing and making it as painless as possible which is why I’m covering three tools that can help you invest and save with minimal effort.</p>

<h2 id="acorns">Acorns</h2>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_appstore_screenshots.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>They get their name from the same idea that squirrels have: when you find an acorn, you bury it in the ground and save it for winter. In this case, however, we’re not burying our money when we have extra change, we’re investing it.﻿﻿﻿ <a href="https://www.acorns.com">Acorns</a> is an iOS and Android app that allows you to take the spare change from each of your regular purchases you make on a debit or credit card and invest it.</p>

<p>For example, You spend $5.49 on coffee on Monday morning so you roll up that $5.49 to $6.00 and the remaining $0.51 is invested. You can do this automatically via the app or on your own, if you wish. It’s easier to think about than it seems because once you get into the habit of expecting all your purchases to be rounded to the next dollar, it’s cake. Personally, I do it manually, and that might work for you as well. They require minimum deposits of $5.00 so once your roll-ups reach that amount, a deposit will occur into your Acorns account (if you do it automatically). You can also have Acorns make regular deposits as well on a recurring basis if you so desire. You can even deposit your cashback you get on your credit cards! </p>

<p>Acorns offers five different investment plans, with each one having a unique blend of stocks (via ETFs) and bonds, depending on your style. If you’re looking for growth, a more aggressive plan will be more to your liking, while a conservative plan is better for keeping your capital locked in on a slow but steady path. You can use the app to determine how much your money might grow over time with their projection graphs and see how your money is doing on the home screen day by day. As an added bonus for Android users, you can see your account’s value in real time via their widget on your home screen! As an iPhone user, this is something that I’m actually very envious about. </p>

<p>Acorns is free on both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acorns-invest-spare-change/id883324671?mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acorns.android&amp;hl=en">Android</a> and takes roughly two business days to be fully signed up as they are an investment firm and have to follow the same rules as everyone else. They’re also open only to users within the United States (as they need a social security number). </p>

<h2 id="betterment">Betterment</h2>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_betterment_screenshots.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a long-term play and want a platform that can help you do some serious investing, Betterment is the game you want to play. ﻿Signing up is dead simple and their plans help you find a good place to start putting your money. On their homepage, all you need to do is punch in your age, if you’re retired, and how much you make, and they’ll cook up three awesome plans for you to choose from, starting with saving to create an emergency fund/nest egg. Having one of these is important as sometimes life happens and one should never rely on credit cards. </p>

<p>Once you’re signed up and verified, you can browse your account on their site or using their mobile app. Their plans are similar to Acorns in that your money is automatically allotted into specific categories of ETFs based on how the money is to be treated.</p>

<p>One thing to make sure I note is that unlike Acorns and RobinHood, Betterment does have a fee structure that you should be aware of, even though it’s super small and if you’re actively investing, you’ll barely notice. Their fee structure is based on your investment amount and they even provide an equivalent cost per month in real dollars and cents. For someone investing under $10,000 to start, they’ll be looking at an annual rate of 0.35% or roughly one dollar per month. This entry level plan requires a minim $100 auto-deposit every month. If you’re not comfortable with that yet or just don’t have the cash to make that kind of deposit, yet, don’t worry. Betterment assesses a flat fee of $3 per month for accounts with deposits of less than $100.</p>

<p>At $10,000, an investor can see the annual rate drop to 0.25% which will run roughly two dollars per month. (It’s important for me to note that the lower rate doesn’t start until $10,000 so an investor with $9,999 will be subject to the higher 0.35% minimum rate.) If you’re an investor who might be rolling in it and is working with $100,000, the rate drops again to 0.15% or roughly $13 per month.</p>

<p>With each step to higher better pricing structures, you’ll be offered additional services such as Tax Loss Harvesting ($50,000 minimum) and a personal advisor ($500,000 minimum). </p>

<p>For those who are unsure about the whole idea, rest easy with a 30-day no-cost intro option. At the end of 30 days, you’ll be placed into a plan based on your deposit status during the 30-day window.</p>

<p>The Betterment app is available for free on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/betterment-smarter-investing./id393156562?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterment&amp;hl=en">Google Play Store</a>.</p>

<h2 id="robinhood">RobinHood﻿</h2>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_robinhood_screenshots.png?resize=753%2C268" alt="" /></p>

<p>RobinHood is probably the slickest of the three app-services I describe here, today. One thing that’s plagued investors for a long time is that every time you make a trade, you have to pay a fee. That’s all fine and dandy if you have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars you’re moving around at any one time. A $250,000 trade minus $10 is nothing (0.004%, to be exact). For those who have smaller portfolios, say around the $1k to $10k range, those $10 fees add up ($10 from $1000 is 1%, a 250x increase). RobinHood’s goal is to stop making that a problem. They make their money off of you being their customer, so they don’t really need to charge you <em>any</em> per trade. Like Acorns, RobinHood is an app-only service so you can’t trade on your computer (yet). It’s technically not open to the public yet but they have been ramping up their beta enrollment quite a bit as of late. It’s definitely work looking into as it gives anyone with any amount of money access to buy stock without having to worry about losing a large fraction of their money every time they buy and sell. </p>

<p>You can sign up to get yourself on the waiting list at  <a href="https://www.robinhood.com">robinhood.com</a> and get the app on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-$0-commission-stock/id938003185?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Apple App Store</a>.</p>

        Through an Open Window
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-02-06T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">06 Feb 2015</time>

    <p>One thing I’ve never liked about being up early in the morning is how dark it is outside throughout the winter. It’s hard getting up at 4AM and seeing nothing but the same darkness you saw when you went to bed the night before. Sure there’s a lot of excitement to be had at night, but for those of us with responsibilities, that’s just not an option. Instead I’m indoors, wondering what’s going on in the wee hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Late night and early morning can lead to a lot of great inspiration for when my list of things to talk about is running on fumes. With my regular stents of barfing my brain onto the internet now (practically every day), I have to now take to task the idea that I’m also responsible for regular creative thinking.</p>

<p>What about the night is so interesting?</p>

<p>Why are people attracted to the darkness?</p>

<p>Are day-time clubs even a thing?</p>

<p>I ponder all of these things, and more on a regular basis. Personally, I’ve never been one to go to a night club. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been to night clubs before, and back then it was mildly amusing having some girl rub her sweaty butt crack on me; don’t you think for one second that guys are the only ones that sweat.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it’s not even remotely interesting. Perhaps it has something to do with the idea that I grew up and care about more substantial things in life. If I wanted to pay $20 to drink, listen to overly loud music, and look stupid, I could do that at home, for free. Just saying.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hAAAB5DC6.gif"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hAAAB5DC6.gif?resize=500%2C323" alt="hAAAB5DC6" /></a></p>

<p>The night also harbors the second and third shift folks who keep the world running while we all sleep. I know this because I used to be one. Working 4PM to 1AM was awesome when I was 21, single, and caring little about getting up at noon every day. It was great. Leaving work at 1AM led to the most delicious Jack in the Box burgers anyone has ever tasted. They do something differently in the middle of the night because they tasted so much better. Maybe it was just my desire for greasiness in the middle of the night that made me feel that way.</p>

<p>All this pondering and reflecting on the night makes me wonder about a possible side project: regular stories about fictional people based on real people out being adventurous at night. Sounds like it could be good. One concern I have is how often I will be willing to stay up late at night and take notes. I sure as hell can’t magically come up with stories. The tales have to have some sort of truth behind them; that’s what makes them great! Otherwise, it’s just another story.</p>

<p>Perhaps more brainstorming is on the way…when the sun comes up.</p>

    <p>In 2007, The Onion—known for being the global source for all things truth—called RadioShack’s Demise. Today, RadioShack filed for bankruptcy protection. RadioShack is down, I see Fry’s coming soon. Have you been in one lately? They’re massive and never have anyone in them.</p>

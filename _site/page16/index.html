    <p>Real quickly I wanted to give a shoutout to my wife. She’s the one in the image above.</p>

<p>We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary last weekend and it also roughly marked the point where we started dating three and a half years ago.</p>

<p>She’s been my best support system throughout all of this. I’d go anywhere for her—and in fact I <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/scared-to-act">already</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/be-ready">am</a>. I can’t want for what life holds in store for us in the next several years as we make our way to California and spend the better part of a decade there.</p>

<p>It’ll be a grand new adventure for the both of us, likely more so for me as I’ve never lived outside the state of Washington.</p>

<p>Thanks, Kaysze, you’re the best wife a man could ever ask for <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

    <p>Today is the 55th day of the year, and I’ve made it to 100. I’m not quite sure what the rest of the year holds. As I sit here with my coffee  like I do most mornings, I’m thinking about my <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog">first real stent</a> at blogging, the <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/smart">first goals I set</a> for myself, and when <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/for-february">I changed up those goals</a> shortly after because I ended up blowing through them.</p>

<p>March is coming around soon, so it’ll be time to make slight adjustments, as always. I’m excited for the next 100 posts. Let’s see what happens!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sure sign of an amateur is he has a million plans and they all start tomorrow.What plans start today?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m guilty of this. The idea of ‘why do today what you can put off until tomorrow.’ It’s a terrible way to think and it leads to more procrastination. </p>

<p>My struggle with this rears its ugly head even more now as I’m simultaneously going to school, doing job training, and searching for a new job in a place I’ve never really been to (outside of a few hours). I definitely don’t have the advantage of being local. I also don’t have the advantage of being a brain child or software development prodigy so in an area where not only tech jobs are a dime a dozen, but people to fill them are a nickel a dozen, my work is cut out for me. </p>

<p>I’m not saying it’s impossible: leads are starting to trickle in. I’m saying it’s an uphill battle and because I still have time, it’s easy for me to say I’ll work on it tomorrow, or this weekend. Turns out I don’t have that much time. A couple months and change isn’t much time and I have a hard deadline to meet. I have a backup plan but even that’s not a for sure.</p>

<p>With so much riding on this, it’s not something I can hold off doing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find three hobbies you love: one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, and one to be creative.Bonus points if you have one über-hobby that gets you all three. In my case, photography is that hobby. I’m not quite covered on #1 and #2, but  it’ll take time. No hobby is a money printer or ass kicker overnight (unless you print money while standing on one leg holding a medicine ball and painting at the same time). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I do it. It’s hard not to. You see where you’re at in life and look at your friends and maybe they’re ahead of you. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel like crap. </p>

<p>I feel this way because I’ve, yet again, caught myself overflowing with envy and want. While not necessarily bad, when misguided, it can lead to poor relationships or no relationships at all. It’s impossible to have genuine contact with someone you wish you were more like. You can’t just be their friend, colleague, etc., without thinking about how much better they are than you at X. </p>

<p>The key isn’t to think that you want to be like them. The key is to want to do the cool things they do, too. Use that relationship to your advantage! Have them mentor you. Teach you. Make use of the personal contact you have and reach that level you were so envious about.</p>

    <p>I found this <a href="https://medium.com/@drevets/sit-down-shut-up-write-don-t-stop-d3f671d4a41b">Medium post</a> this evening about finding time to write, every day, no matter what:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wanted to tell him to stop being an amateur and just nut up and write every single day, even when he didn’t feel like it, especially when he didn’t feel like it. I wanted to tell him that inspiration is a joke and is about as meaningful as a bartender’s smile. But I didn’t tell him that, mostly because I’m a coward.It doesn’t take rocket science or hours of planning to come up with something to talk about. People say they don’t have anything good to say… wait what? Everyone has good things to say otherwise they wouldn’t ever talk. Instead of rambling that out loud where people won’t likely ever remember it, put it on paper, or put it online in a blog on <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a>, <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://wix.com">Wix</a>, <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, <a href="http://sbvtle.com">Subtle</a>, <a href="http://silvrback.com">Silvrback</a> or <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>. There’s <a href="http://www.thewritesource.com/writing_topics/">countless</a> <a href="http://writingprompts.tumblr.com">resources</a> for <a href="http://www.dailyteachingtools.com/journal-writing-prompts.html">writing</a> and <a href="http://talk.desk.pm">great places</a> to discuss your new flow of creative juices. Find an app on the iTunes, Android or Windows App Stores and note down your thoughts or write out a whole piece to publish later. Find something or someone interesting on the street and write about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next time you go into town (or your largest urban center), travel in a circle around a block for five minutes, stop, look behind you and that’s your next topic. <em>Seriously</em>. There’s so much to talk about and so much to say. We’ve sucked ourselves into a bitch life of social media and not communicating our thoughts and feelings anymore.</p>

<p>When you’re done, read a book. No… read three. Hell… read five. Listening counts, too, so long as you do nothing but listen and imagine yourself with the character(s) in the story. Find a genre of book you wouldn’t normally read or listen to and try it out. What stood out to you about that book and that genre? There’s another topic.</p>

<p>I came up with that stuff in the amount of time it took me to type it. I didn’t rehearse it. Hell, I didn’t rehearse or plan any of this. I literally just wrote it.</p>

<p>Don’t be a pansy. Sit down and write something.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-02-23T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">23 Feb 2015</time>

    <p>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EMXBDMA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EMXBDMA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=EJPMID7W3G3C7TOR">The Martian by Andy Weir</a> lately, and while not a long book, it’s deep. The story follows Mark Watney, one of the first people to step foot on Mars. He also might be one of the first to die on Mars, too…</p>

<p>As I reflect on this story, I can’t help but wonder what it would be like to be alone on Mars, or anywhere for that matter, for an extended period of time. </p>

<p>Think about it for a second:</p>

<p>There’s nothing.</p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>Nada.</p>

<p>Your only friend is dirty mars dirt.</p>

<p>Nothing to do.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>But wait, maybe there is something to do, something to keep your mind occupied. Maybe there’s something to be had out of nothing or very little.</p>

<p>Just like Watney in The Martian, at times we find ourselves in similar situations, in less than ideal circumstances. Sometimes, we’re down to pretty much nothing (read: ramen). It can feel like all hope is lost and there’s no point in continuing to go on. No one is coming to save you and no one is even noticing you’re in a void.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/quitting">talked about having a good support system</a> before, and I’ll mentioned it again. Having good friends and family, even if only a few, around you to keep pushing when it doesn’t seem like there’s a reason is critical. </p>

<p>Imagine where we’d all be if nobody supported each other and we were left to fend for ourselves. No camaraderie, no friendship, no push to do better (or just do). Life would be utterly dismal and meaningless. We give meaning to live and meaning to those living life by supporting one another, even it’ll be a long time before help arrives. Sometimes one needs to duct tape life’s pieces back together to keep them in place in the short term. No one said it had to be permanent.</p>

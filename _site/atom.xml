   <title>After Three Weeks</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started the Bloc Rails Web Development bootcamp three weeks ago and I’d like to go over my experiences so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have been pretty great, actually. There’s a lot of material to cover but it’s done in such a way that it’s broken down into small chunks. Assignments extend on the material being taught and incorporate material learned prior. Each assignment builds on the one before it and the beginning project walks you through the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future projects are more open-ended and require the student to call upon what was learned in order to succeed. I am only a few weeks in after all so I haven’t been able to relfect upon the open-ended projects. However taking a cursory glance at them tells me they’re not overly challenging but they do require dedication and that you paid attention to the introductory courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the next three weeks. With Christmas approaching, I don’t suspect I’ll be as active in the program (I’ve progressed much farther than the minimum states). After the first of the year, I predict I’ll be into one of the open projects and what I’ve learned will be tested. A challenge never hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Seeing the Forest for the Trees</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to miss the small picture when looking at the big picture. Thinking about what I have ahead of me in terms of the next year at Bloc gives me two thoughts: it’s going to take a long time and it’s easy to not see the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloc is a long program. It covers a lot of material in great detail. For the un-initiated, it can take quite some time. I’m told that based on my 72-week track, I should be doing five “checkpoints” per week. It’s Tuesday and I’ve killed seven. I know it might not always be like this and the first weeks are always the “yeah let’s do this!” weeks. As time goes on, the sheer size of the program will really start to show itself but the one thing I’ll need to keep in mind is that no matter how many different &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; I still have to do, I need to just focus on one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I know it, I’ll be done.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Starting Soon: Bloc.io</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/31/starting-soon-bloc-io/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/31/starting-soon-bloc-io</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I officially signed up last week for Bloc.io’s Full-stack developer bootcamp becuase I feel while I can learn a good deal of stuff on my own, I’m not going to make on my own to the level I need to be in order to make a fundamental career shift to software development that will actually still support my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program doesn’t officially start until the 9th of November so I have a little over a week to go. It’ll be a long year and change and a lot of new stuff will come my way. I’ve only scratched the surface of what Ruby and Rails can do. I started a simple Rails app a couple days ago that could one day turn into the platform for any and all of my sites, if I stick to it, enough. Right now, I don’t know enough on how to make it great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, I will, and as I progress the app will improve. My goal is to one day have it replace WordPress as my blog, portfolio of work, and anything else about me I feature online. I may even adapt it to restart my photography portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really looking forward to what I’ll be learning in the coming months and I’ll be sure to share all of it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Fix Misspelled Column Names in a Ruby on Rails Database</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/25/how-to-fix-misspelled-column-names-in-a-ruby-on-rails-database/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/25/how-to-fix-misspelled-column-names-in-a-ruby-on-rails-database</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across a small issue this afternoon while building out one of my first Ruby on Rails apps. When I generated the database table, I misspelled a column name. Luckily for me, it’s easy enough to fix and this is how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-new-migration&quot;&gt;1. Create a New Migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the command line from within your Rails application folder, run this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/d6017c61588d2bfbe2fa.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;View the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/d6017c61588d2bfbe2fa&quot;&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be generating a new database migration with the name FixColumnName (which interprets to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[timestamp]_fix_column_name.rb&lt;/code&gt;) inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db/migrate&lt;/code&gt; folder inside your rails application. Open that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.rb&lt;/code&gt; file and update it so it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/2e29faf460cff05f803b.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;View the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/2e29faf460cff05f803b&quot;&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:table_name&lt;/code&gt; – the name of the table in question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:old_column&lt;/code&gt; – the misspelled column name&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:new_column&lt;/code&gt; – the correct column nameIf you have multiple columns you need to change, introduce additional &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rename_column&lt;/code&gt; functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/9ea9fba6529008ed08dc.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;View the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/9ea9fba6529008ed08dc&quot;&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that after this migration, you’ll need to update your references to the column everywhere within your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like a simple fix but as someone who’s relatively new to Ruby on Rails, this saved me a load of time figuring out what to do and preventing me from starting over.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Future Ruby on Rails Developer</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/23/future-ruby-on-rails-developer/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/23/future-ruby-on-rails-developer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Rails Developer” has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my hunt to figure out where I want my career to head long term, I keep coming back to the idea of software development. I’ve told stories about how I had a rare opportunity a couple years back and I didn’t take it. Well, this time I’m the one creating the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m working on a self-paced course through &lt;a href=&quot;http://codermanual.com&quot;&gt;Coder Manual&lt;/a&gt; and I’m having a great time. However, it may be billed as a complete “bootcamp” but the next stage for me really needs to be one-on-one with a touch of free-wheeling. It’s easy to follow along and build the same stuff the instructor is building. Where the real learning takes place is when free flowing creativity starts to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloc.io&quot;&gt;Bloc&lt;/a&gt; comes in. A long-term coding bootcamp, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloc.io&quot;&gt;Bloc&lt;/a&gt; covers front end, rails, and full stack development with the end goal of being job-ready as a junior ruby on rails developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve considered other languages like Python, Java, Swift and Objective-C, but none of those really hit home for me what I want to do. Rails as a platform allows developers to build complex and fully-featured web applications that can do amazing things while not having to focus on the medial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to what’s ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Returning to Morning Greatness</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/21/returning/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/21/returning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I decided to shake things up a little but when it comes to my morning routine. By shake things up I mean go back to what I used to do that seemed to work so well. And by what I used to do I mean be creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked about this struggle, before, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/moving-to-cali/&quot;&gt;moving to California&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-2/&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-3/&quot;&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-4/&quot;&gt;therein&lt;/a&gt;) really &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/reset/&quot;&gt;messed up&lt;/a&gt; my &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/?s=routine&quot;&gt;routine&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve decided enough is enough and am slowly working my way back into the old swing. Yesterday, and every day before, I would get up at 8 or even sometimes 7 AM. That’s way too late in my book. My new goal is to return to my 5 AM rise time which will allow me to exercise my mind with tasks I enjoy before work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a cup of &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/09/the-cold-brew-coffee-adventure/&quot;&gt;my home made cold brew iced coffee&lt;/a&gt; at my desk, today is day one of that goal. I didn’t make it at 5 AM, but I did get up early. I figure every day I can push a little bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what inspired all this? A little site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mymorningroutine.com&quot;&gt;My Morning Routine&lt;/a&gt;. Every Wednesday a new individual is featured on the cover and they spend a few minutes talking about their morning routine and why it’s important to them. You can follow this up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mymorningroutine.com/statistics/&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; on each of the routines archived and the key points to take away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: did you know the average bed time for their respondants is 11:14 PM? That seems so late to me, but in reality, it’s not. It really depends on what you’re doing at that time. If I wanted to wake up at 5 AM, that may be a bit late, but in my case, 9 PM may not be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found it interesting that 68% of the people featured meditate or practice yoga in some fashion. This intrigues me because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/headspace/&quot;&gt;my inital success with meditation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories give me some fuel to shape my own morning routine that I find to work best for me. I’ve added a bit of extra work on top from the sole fact that I’m starting this at the time of year in California when it’s dark until almost 8 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it be hard? Probably, but the best things in life are the ones we have to work hardest for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to documenting my progress and eventually looking back and wondering how I was able to get by with practically doing just the bare minimum to stay alive (or so it’ll likely seem).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The iMac as Told From the Inside</title>

  &lt;p&gt;“When we did the previous mouse we spent so much time dialing those feet, the material, the geometry, everything, so that it sounds good and feels good when you move it on the table,” says Ternus, whose title is VP for Mac, iPad, Ecosystem and Audio Engineering. “But then you change the mass of the product and you change the resonant frequency of the product and all of a sudden the feet that we loved weren’t great anymore. They weren’t what we wanted.”&lt;br /&gt;
What exactly was wrong with it? I wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;
“It had just changed… kind of… the sound,” says Ternus, who has been working for Apple since 2001. “They all make a noise — the question is getting a noise we like. It sounded… not right.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/backchannel/exclusive-why-apple-is-still-sweating-the-details-on-imac-531a95e50c91#.oqvpl2xok&quot;&gt;Steven Levy&lt;/a&gt; received an exclusive view into the world of development behind Apple’s new iMacs and other hardware.

   <title>Headspace</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/20/headspace/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/20/headspace</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m always looking for new an interesting ways to stimulate my brain. I’m also always looking for new ways to clear my head when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; comes in. I’ve used Headspace for a total of one day as of this writing and so far, I’m pretty impressed. Only time will tell if it’ll be worth investing money in. After my first session, I did feel a bit more relaxed and “with the program.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headspace is free with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/buy&quot;&gt;premium subscription&lt;/a&gt; option. Once you get past the first level, you need to pay, but the price is pretty affordable. Paying monthly will set you back $12.95 each month. If you pay up a year in advance, it drops to the equivalvent of $7.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start using Headspace, you’re greeted by a soft spoken gentleman (his name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/andy-puddicombe&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;) who first walks you through the process and how Headpsace works. Once you dive in, you’re introduced to your first ten minute session. Find a place where you won’t be bothered. You don’t necessarily have to find a quiet place, as the voiceover will help you take advantage of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can work through the daily meditations on your computer via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;headspace.com&lt;/a&gt; or on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app&quot;&gt;mobile app&lt;/a&gt; available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app&quot;&gt;all major mobile platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel like paying? Subscribing to Headspace opens up a whole host of situation-specific meditations for things like health, mental performance, and even a series on how to improve your meditation game. One category I find the most beneficial is the SOS category of meditations. If you’re working through a troubling situation or are literally freaking out, the SOS option will help you get your head back in the game and bring your mind back down to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t give away the rest but I will say that I enjoyed my first Headspace experience. I recommend you give it a shot. I think you’l enjoy it, too. Check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;headspace.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Formula E: All the Speed Without the Noise</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/19/formula-e-all-the-speed-without-the-noise/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/19/formula-e-all-the-speed-without-the-noise</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wish this type of racing would come to my neck of the woods. In this video, Formula E is described as being the quietest race in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuyxR3MRg5c?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is Formula E, exactly? It’s F1 racing with electricity-powered cars. Because they’re electric, they’re inherently much quieter. If you want a good idea of what to expect at a race like this, checkout the above video. For an idea of what a whole race is like, checkout the below video featuring the Formula E 2015 Round 7 race in Monaco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/juwUZGNags8?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, these races are much shorter (40-60 laps), but even still, these races are still exciting and the cars zip around like that Tesla you wish you owned. Watch out for the beginning action. During the broadcast they keep track of each car’s charge levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Formula E. It’s not on TV very often here in my market (likely because F1 races typically get delegated to some of the lesser-watched Fox networks and Comcast doesn’t carry like Fox Sports 2).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a mac user for four years and I can honestly say that I’ve spent less time needing to maintain my systems than any Windows PC I’ve never owned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not really news that IBM rolling out the usage of Macs for its employees, but one thing that’s made at least small headlines is that after rolling out 1900 Macs a week, IBM made an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; during a talk at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/&quot;&gt;JAMF Nation User Conference&lt;/a&gt; that during their deployments and thereafter, the number of Mac users who’ve contacted their tech support for assistance has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/&quot;&gt;several times&lt;/a&gt; less than their PC counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To much fanfare from the crowd, Previn said that IBM is deploying 1,900 Macs per week and currently have 130,000 Macs and iOS devices in the hands of users. And all of these devices are supported by a total of 24 help desk staff members, meaning that each staff member effectively supports 5,375 employees. One stat that particularly stood out was that 5% of Mac users call the help desk, compared to 40% of PC users. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Costs of Technology</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/14/the-costs-of-technology/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/14/the-costs-of-technology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty common knowledge that the cost of technology goes down over time, but there’s one category, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10&quot;&gt;Buisness Insider&lt;/a&gt; in this rather impressive graphic, that’s actually become more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20151014_prices_bi.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top line (green if you’re color blind) is the cable/satellite/radio category. What I’m not sure of is if this category covers Internet as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things I know for sure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s less Internet and television competition in the United States than there should be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m paying less than I did a few years ago.
Regarding that second point: I may be in the minority, and I probably know more than the average person on how to land the best deal possible on my information services. Part of me wonders if increasing royalties (radio) and retransmissions fees (aka broadcast network greed) are just blindly being passed on to consumers. It wouldn’t surprise me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way Internet prices go down is via competition. I live in an area that may someday have Google Fiber (it’s on the list of “potential” cities) and as such, Comcast charges me $135/month for roughly 175mbps of download bandwidth and 220 channels on TV including HBO, Streampix, DVR service, and whatever else that all comes with. In essence, I’m paying $67.50 a month for a 175mbps Internet connection. While Google Fiber would cost roughly $70 for the same basic prospect and raise the limit to 1000mbps, it would be hard to take advantage of that full speed without spending several hundred extra dollars to upgrade my WiFi hardware to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, also, is that I shouldn’t have to get 220 cable channels to get that kind of price for Internet, but I do. I enjoy watching TV so in my case I get my money’s worth. Cord cutting would cost more, every month (by around +$20) and would come with siloed content services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without getting too far off course, we still shouldn’t be seeing the overall price of these services rising. It doesn’t matter the reason. If something’s moving the market in a direction that’s affecting profits, figure out how to make your service more appealing to the mass market, again, don’t just programatically raise rates to counteract and keep those coffins padded with C-notes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Never Quitting</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/14/on-never-quitting/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/14/on-never-quitting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a trend that occurs every few months with me when it comes to my writing. I find myself, and I lose myself, and I repeat. I battle with staying consistent every day and writing something, even if it’s not that interesting. When I first started blogging on a regular basis, I did it in the morning before work as a way to get my mind right and get focused for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t feel like I need to do that before I go to work (my job is much more satisfying) so the time I’ve set aside to write has pretty much drifted off into space. I never came up with an alternate solution to fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, maker of &lt;a href=&quot;http://desk.pm&quot;&gt;Desk&lt;/a&gt; (the minimal blogging and publishing app collection), and habitual blogger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do&quot;&gt;John Saddington&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/seth-on-6000/&quot;&gt;reflected&lt;/a&gt; on sticking with something and “ &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/seth-on-6000/&quot;&gt;showing up every day&lt;/a&gt;” and it really gave me the boost I need to jump start my creative juices, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so easy for me to blame the lack of creativity when it comes to missing a day, and there were a lot of those. When I first started this blog right after New Years 2015, I was showing up and writing several thousand words a week. Within the first twelve weeks, I put down almost 60,000 words on digital blogging paper and I enjoyed it. I cranked out thoguhts and musings every weekday morning from 5-6AM and didn’t feel like I didn’t have enough time. I just sat down and wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my Wife and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/&quot;&gt;moved to California&lt;/a&gt;, my routine changed, and it put a huge damper on things. We moved to an area we weren’t huge fans of, and I just couldn’t get comfortable. It was hard for me to focus, to be honest, and the environment played a huge factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/moving/&quot;&gt;moved, again&lt;/a&gt;, to a much more satisfying neighborhood, I feel like I can focus, again. I don’t feel like I’m having to battle with everything around me for some musing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone who’s likely written over &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/9000-posts/&quot;&gt;ten thousand&lt;/a&gt; blog posts (9500+ of which are on &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/9000-posts/&quot;&gt;his current blog&lt;/a&gt;) says something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;continuing to move forward, personally, professionally, whatever it may be, is the most important thing that you can be doing. Creating momentum and being as confident as you can be in those few steps is life-giving, life-changing.I pay attention. This is advice I can use not only in my side worlds, but in my personal and professional worlds, too. When it comes to improving myself to land a better job doing the next great thing with the next great company or just showing up to be the best husband that I can be to my wife is all I need. Everything else will fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much has happened in the last couple years. I can’t wait to see what the next couple years have in store. The number of potential opportunties around me will grow and my time to jump will happen soon… I just have to continue working to reach my greatest level of awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every time we meet or communicate with someone, be it face to face, over the phone (who does that anymore), text message, email, Skype, etc., we have a fresh opportunity to make the best of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/&quot;&gt;High Existence&lt;/a&gt; has a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; listing 25 “ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/&quot;&gt;life hacks&lt;/a&gt;” to make the most of social situations. Number eight is key for me. I’m terrible at remembering names. Number 12 is so true, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key in all this isn’t to necessarily dominate in a conversation, but to use certain things, triggers, the environment, and each others strengths and weaknesses to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit there are quite a few in this article that I could learn and use in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Enemies Considered</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have I not destroyed my enemy when I have made him into my friend? ~ Abraham Lincoln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So often we spend all of our time trying to literally destroy our enemies and fail to understand that while it may feel good in the short term to have conquered someone with negativity, we’re just terrible people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to say that while not in the heat of the moment, and sure, words slip from time to time. The point is that using words to put someone down—accidentally or otherwise—didn’t just happen by chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using all this energy to bring someone down to your level or below, why not lift them up? There may be a reason why you dislike an individual today, but that reason may not exist for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actions that once committed lead to irreversable consiquences, and in those cases, it’s wise to just move on without that person in or around your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, you might be surprised how easy it is to defeat your enemies by becoming friends with them. You might find that whatever was bothering you about them wasn’t actually that bad, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Re-Invent High School</title>

   <updated>2015-10-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/10/re-invent-high-school</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Going to keep this one simple: I wish High School had prepared me for real life. High School never taught me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Real money management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Real job search skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer engineering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neutral views on social issues
You know what I did learn? A lot about the past. It seemed like every class taught me stuff that people discovered a long time ago, but not how it was relevant to the present day. Homer wrote some books and some mathematical equations were discovered quite some time ago, but how can I apply this to real life, the life that’s in the present?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I find out, I’ll tell you, because high school didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ScreenShot2015-10-10at12.05.52PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xqsuperschool.org&quot;&gt;XQ, The Super School Project&lt;/a&gt; aims to reinvent the high school and make it something that can acutally teach kids what’s relevant for today’s world. We’re not just talking about stuff like how to program. Learning [subject] is important, but not in the context of memorization and anecdotal fact memorization (the current method); [subject] is important in the context of how it can be applied today, right now. What about Greek Mythology can I use right now, to do something or make an advancement in my career or society?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a good question.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve started learning Ruby on Rails. One thing I want for myself in the next year or so is to do more software development. As an added bonus, if my career shifted into that type of work, I wouldn’t mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Rails because of it’s completeness. It’s not just a language—ruby is the language. It’s a complete framework for building any kind of web app you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of ideas on web apps I want to build and some of them could turn into real things that could make money. In order to be able to do that, though, I have to have a platform to build upon. I think Rails is it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting here, looking at my computer screen, and am mesmerized by the desktop background. I feel like I need to be there, instead. Then I wonder… why aren’t I? The trip is only a few hours from the Bay Area to Yosemite and El Capitan, the land structure off of which the latest version of Apple’s Mac OS X is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t gone on enough adventures this year. This last year so far has been crazy. Moving from one end of the left coast to the other took a latent toll on everything. Adjusting has taken some time. I know I used to write a lot more than I do now. I used to have a routine. Now, things just kind of happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only October, though. I still have almost three months left in this year to do something and there is always next year, too. New Year’s Resolutions are for chumps, though. If I make any plans, I’m just going to do them. I don’t need some special ritual to convince me I need to do X.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Difference Four Years Makes</title>

   <updated>2015-10-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/02/the-difference-four-years-makes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I received my new Macbook Pro, today, thanks to the wonderful folks at UPS. It’s in my hands now and I’m super excited. I’ve only spent about 20 minutes with it so far and here are a few things that stand out to me from the start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When spinning up FileFault encryption from the initial setup screen, expect the mac to get warm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inital estimation on how long FileVault would take was six days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I LOLed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One cannot upgrade to El Capitan without FileVault complete. This cannot be stopped mid-process, ergo:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One should not enable FileVault from the start if they plan on upgrading directly to El Capitan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;N00b.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That Screen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That read/write speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The power cord is much easier to dislodge than the older pre-retina Macbook Pros. This is something I will have to get used to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not having a 2nd spinning drive makes this system near silent. I can’t really hear it, now, even though it’s a small furnace at the moment with all the disk I/O.
That’s all that jumped out at me right away. When File Vault is done, I’ll follow up with disk benchmarks. I’m looking forward to seeing how wide that canyon is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>The Difference Four Years Makes: Part 2: Disk IO</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/02/the-difference-four-years-makes-part-2-disk-io/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is something I’ve been waiting to see for a long time. As you’re aware, I’ve been using a four year old Macbook Pro for quite some time (placed the order in June 2011) and today I’ve finally made the upgrade to a 2015 of the same make and model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I was excited to see the most above all else is the disk I/O speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s compare…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-02-16.42.35.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-02-16.42.35.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-10-02 16.42.35&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-02-at-4.40.41-PM-952x1024.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2015-10-02 at 4.40.41 PM&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big difference, eh? The former is a SATA 6Gb SSD (Toshiba 128GB) and the latter is a PCI-e SSD (256GB). My how times change.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was combing Rotten Tomatoes’ reviews of The Martian, and one popped out at me as one of those reviews that make it seem like the reviewer didn’t actually watch the movie and or didn’t know there was a book…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2015/10/walk-visual-magic-one-few-films-which-3d-justified&quot;&gt;Ryan Gibley&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2015/10/walk-visual-magic-one-few-films-which-3d-justified&quot;&gt;The Statesman&lt;/a&gt; said this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All the while, he is keeping a video diary in which he is sassy (“In your face, Neil Armstrong!”) as he outlines every step of his plan to make contact with Planet Earth. It’s almost as if he knows he’s a character in a movie.What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who read the book, I can tell you Matt Damon’s character, Mark Watney, is like this in the book, too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Replacing My Four-Year-Old Macbook Pro</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/01/replacing-my-four-year-old-macbook-pro/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/01/replacing-my-four-year-old-macbook-pro</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So it’s finally happening. After over four years—52 months to be exact—my Early-2011-era Macbook Pro is being retired. In its place is going a new Macbook Pro of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a bit of time thinking about what would replace my daily workhorse. I’ve put this system through the ringer and it’s held up amazingly well. Through all the days I’ve toted it to an office to use instead of my work machine (lol Windows) and the number of times most other laptops would have given up the ghost, my Mac has held up. It’s seen a total of five versions of OS X, now, including the latest, El Capitan. I started with OS X Snow Leopard and rocked that for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still vaguely remember what it was like to pay for operating system upgrades, although that memory is quickly fleeting. I used to think paying $30 for an upgrade was miles better than the high prices of Windows. Now, I think $30 is too much and am not sure what I would do if Apple started charging, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new system arrives tomorrow courtesy of UPS and I’m looking forward to one thing more than faster this and that: the weight. I’ve gotten used to the near six pounds that my current Macbook Pro weighs, but the Mid-2015 model clocks in at 4.5. It might not seem that much lighter, but tied in with the size difference, it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, though, I’m looking forward to the external monitor support. The unit I purchased only has integrated graphics but those integraphics (new word) can drive two 4K monitors plus the built-in display at the same time. Talk about screen real estate. Sure it’s not going to hold up well for gaming, but I didn’t guy it for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday can’t come soon enough (tomorrow?). See you then! I’m sure I’ll have things to share about my new, fancy laptop this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Cold Brew Coffee Adventure</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/09/28/the-cold-brew-coffee-adventure/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/09/28/the-cold-brew-coffee-adventure</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been experimenting with brewing my own coffee like the ways of the eskimos: cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, maybe they brewed their coffee hot. I’m just guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this whole ‘small-batch’ trend is quite invariably hipster and I’m certainly one of the last people to jump on that bandwagon, but sometimes one just has to concede when another makes superior coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus I knew it went mainstream when Starbucks started offering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is this cold-brew coffee I speak of and why is it so much better?Let me keep it simple, since I don’t want to bore you with all the sicence-y stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of running hot water through ground coffee, you let ground coffee “seep” in a bucket/pitcher/container of cool water for 12-24 hours. Once it’s sat and stewed in its own substance, filter out the grounds. I use a large mixing bowl as the catch device. Cheesecloth works well for filtering so long as you kept your grounds coarse. If it’s fine powder, you might be better off with a coffee filter (although the filtering process will take much longer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mixture is roughly 3.5 to 4 cups of grounds per one gallon of cold tap water. I don’t pack the grounds into the measuring cup. You’ll need about 1/3 to 1/2 lb of ground coffee beans to make this happen. In my home, one gallon of the liquid energy lasts through about six 20-oz cups with ice filled about half way. For my wife and I, that’s three days. We add a splash of sweet-cream creamer (two splashes for me, I like it sweet and ass kicking at the same time) and it’s done. We used to use simple syrup like the coffee shops but at $5 per 12oz bottle, I was using 1/3 the bottle per one gallon of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how the coffee chains make it but this is my process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice about the flavor is it’s a lot richer, but not as bitter. When we used to brew hot coffee, we’d get light roast beans for the least bitterness possible. Now, we use whatever because the flavor profile seems to be more consistent and the level of bitterness just isn’t there in the cold coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a lot stronger. That hot liquid in your coffee maker has seconds with the grounds. We’re giving the liquid hours to really make something special out of their time together. If I skip breakfast, I’m taking it to 11 within an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to price, there’s no question on how much cheaper this process is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Starbucks, it’s $3.55 plus tax for a 20-oz cold-brew iced coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup-1024x508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By my math and based on my costs, it’s running us $2.75 to $3.00 for one gallon of cold-brew iced coffee, or $0.42 to $0.47 per 20-oz cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously ice plays a factor in all this and the cost varies but there’s no doubting that we’re saving quite a bit of money in exchange for roughly 20 minutes of my day (10 in the beginning to grind and 10 to filter at the end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it worth it? Totally. One thing I’d do differently, though is get some sort of pitcher that has a core to keep the grounds in that can be pulled out and emptied. I’m facing cheesecloth damage and stray grounds-in-my-brew issues. Pitchers like this sell for $20 on Amazon. Also worth the purchase, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;TL/DR&lt;/em&gt; is to charge your Apple Watch in the morning while you get ready for your day (take a shower, get dressed, etc) and then again in the evening while you get ready for bed (brush teeth, put on pajamas, etc).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems like the company is starting to shift its focus, if only a little bit. Instead of forming links people can use to reach new heights in their careers, LinkedIn is encouraging people to actually — get this — talk to the people in their circles.While these companies may be putting Slack “in their crosshairs” doesn’t mean they’re a good shot.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lies for Money</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/08/28/lies-for-money</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received an email just a bit ago of the political donation variety. It’s worth mentioning that a few years ago I guess I ended up on a Scott Walker mailing list. I’m not entirely sure how that happened, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I unsubscribed this morning, I actually read the email and there were two things that stood out to me. First, this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The governor emailed me early this morning specifically asking for your help before the end of the month.Did he, now? Does he even know who I am? Given I haven’t given him a dollar in the history of ever, I wonder why he was so interested in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mass email was a “forward” of the “email” that Scott Walker “sent” via his “iPhone.” I put all those words in quotes because I don’t think it actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second line was amusing, too, and made me chuckle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Colleen, I’ve been reviewing grassroots leaders in the 98036 zip code and I don’t have Johnathan’s contact info. Will you please send them a message asking for an urgent contribution before the end of the month? We really need them on our team.Let me know as soon as you hear from Johnathan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’re trying to get money from me by making me believe that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin actually emailed you, citing me, and a zip code I don’t live in, on purpose? Because I’ve given zero dollars, I’m somehow probably good for donating a bunch of cash on short notice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty weak, but then again, this is American PoliticsTM for you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Conquering the Dev Career</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/08/27/conquering-the-dev-career</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you asked me how I felt about this topic a few years ago, I would have told you it’s dumb. If you asked me how I felt about becoming a software developer, I would have told you I’d never do it, it’s not something I find interesting. If you told me that we could fast forward three years and my tone would be different, I would have laughed in your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are, three years later. I’m slowly starting to entertain development-related career paths. It’s an uphill battle, for sure, and it’ll take quite a bit of time to work out, but I see a future ahead of me that I didn’t see before. One thing that’s different about now is where I live. Here in Silicon Valley, software is everything. No one gives two shits about hardware because it’s become so heavily commoditized. The homeless guy pushing his shopping cart down the street right now probably has a DigitalOcean account and is stealthily building his startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At no point am I saying “me too” when it comes to making an app or building a thing. I do, however, like building things, and software helps me do that. I can still draw upon my roots in this new space but it’s important for me to be open and ready to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next year is going to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I never did when I moved my blog to johnathanlyman.com and away from jlyman.net was to add SSL. I had SSL set up and running on jlyman.net purely because of the low cost of entry. At $10/year, basic SSL gives great HTTPS encryption. Privacy is important, and while I don’t take or give sensetive personal information, it’s still a nice thing to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added SSL to this domain last week and am thinking I made a great choice. Every site I fire up from now on will have it. It’s hard to say no at $10 a year… I think I waste more than that on crap I end up throwing away.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about things that entertain me, this morning, and one thing that came to mind was how long I’ve followed the less-than-family-friendly &lt;a href=&quot;http://explosm.net&quot;&gt;Explosm&lt;/a&gt; comic series.

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/08/06/eleven-million</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first numbers for Apple Music are in and it’s an interesting amount. From Marco Cava at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/05/apple-music-hooks-11-million-trial-members-app-store-has-record-july/31197721/&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So the estimates of 10 million floating around last week were in the right neighborhood. Of course, 11 million users who aren’t actually handing over any money doesn’t really mean much at this point—now Apple has to retain those users after the remaining two months of the free trial are up.I have your answer: make it worth their money. It’s easy to get eleven million people to sign up for something they can get for free with you but have to pay for, elsewhere. The key will be if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/02/apple-music-launch-issues/&quot;&gt;level of frustration&lt;/a&gt; coming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3camwc/frustrations_of_a_spotify_user_switching_to_apple/&quot;&gt;from some&lt;/a&gt; has more or less weight than the idea of being able to use a first party app that ties in with your regular iTunes library.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple World Today has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/8/5/it-may-be-time-to-eradicate-flash-from-your-mac-heres-how&quot;&gt;quick piece on dumping flash&lt;/a&gt;. If you need it, I feel bad for you. If you don’t need it, get rid of it. Adobe Flash has been riddled with holes almost since day one and has never gotten better. It’s 2015 and with the level of intricacy front-end UI frameworks provide, there’s no need for it. Flash needs to go away for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you’ve already dumped it. I keep Google Chrome around just in case and if Flash is an absolute must.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My First Legitimate Vagrantfile</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/28/my-first-legitimate-vagrantfile/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/28/my-first-legitimate-vagrantfile</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’ve created this sort of new kind of being. Previously, I had rarely used Vagrant or Docker or anything of the sort, so the idea of being able to craft an on-demand virtual machine with whatever the hell I want inside of it was both exciting and terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux isn’t foreign to me, and neither is the idea of automation, but after being so accustomed to working in a Windows environment against my better judgement for several years, there was a lot of cobweb removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I could have prevented the aging of my knowledge by staying up to date on every development and deployment technology I could get my hands on. There are, however, only so many hours in the day. Something had to give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m paying for that decision as I work on slowing transitioning myself into a more software-development oriented career path. I enjoy ops-y stuff, but I like building things. I like tinkering (hacking?). My boss made a joke today about how involved I get whenever there’s a discussion about minor HTML tweaks to one of our sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey… I like that shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that made it easier for me to get into this new and soon-to-be-awe-inspiring technology is that I had a purpose. There was a clear goal I wanted to meet and beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our software offerings runs on JIRA. If you’re unfamiliar with the product, it’s a Java-based project management/issue tracking/development/agile tool for organize and keep track of just about anything. Software companies and app development teams are likely the largest consumers of this product. On a regular basis, my team is spinning up and burning down JIRA instances in the never-ending hunt for bug reproduction, walkthroughs, and everyday troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, installing JIRA by hand isn’t fun if you’re running a Linux box. The Windows installer is pretty hands-off but Windows is Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My end goal was to be able to fire up the almighty Vagrant, have it build out a Linux image with a database, JIRA, and be ready to accept input in the browser. I piggy-backed off a couple other like-minded setups I found on GitHub so it only took a couple hours to get it doing what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jelyman2/vagrant-jira-mysql&quot;&gt;here’s the link&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a work in progress as I’d like to someday have data pre-filled and JIRA pre-installed. I’m not sure how feasible that is given JIRA’s licensing structure. For the uninitiated, the license key is unique and time-based. The key starts to wither away the moment its generated instead of the system stopping working after 30 days from install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I might try the same with Docker. I’d love to be able to manage a cluster of these types of setups that can be built up and torn down as needed with little overhead. Instead of making the pre-game ritual longer, I want to make it shorter but more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sunday Fun Day</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/26/sunday-fun-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s Sunday, and the one thing I enjoy doing on Sunday is watching (American) football. Since it’s still 19 days away from the Seahawk’s first pre-season game–that I might end up missing because I live in California, now, and DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket is both over-priced and only available on DirecTV–I might have to find my way to a Seahawks bar… if they even exist in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t end up working out, my guess is it’ll be chores and projects… and games. I try to fit in some game time whenever I can because it’s relaxing for me. being able to shut off for a bit and kill some monsters is almost as good as coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Docker (Briefly)</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/24/on-docker-briefly</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I discovered Docker, I’ve been a fan. Trying to explain Docker to the un-initiated is also fun. I describe it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Docker is like a Lunchable (or bento box). The container of said Lunchable is Docker and the VM it controls. Every section inside the container is each of the apps it runs.I try to tell folks that you use a Virtual Machine if you need to control an entirely specific environment. You use Docker if your interest is just with apps. In this day and age, trying to maintain a fleet of systems or virtual machines can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been internally reflecting on the future of my career quite a bit over the last month or so. One thing I know for sure is where I want my career to head, but what I’m not 100% sure about is how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My overall plan is to pivot into software development. I enjoy solving technical puzzles, fixing things, and making things, all of which can be accomplished with great detail and satisfaction in software development. At this time I haven’t picked a single language or group of languages to stick to and become an expert in. I feel that’ll come within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I have to figure out how to best build up these new skills I require while still maintaining my current day job, which I don’t dislike.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>10 Web-based CSS Tools</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/16/css-tools/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/16/css-tools</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much impossible to design a site without CSS these days. It controls everything. CSS has a hand in so many visual aspects of a site that it can get daunting to keep track of it all or figure out how to tweak it just a certain way. I came up with a list of various web-based CSS tools that can assist any designer in their front-end development quest. If there’s something I missed, please add it to the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rocket&quot;&gt;Rocket&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rocket.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rocket-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;rocket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://minimamente.com/example/rocket/&quot;&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt; Helps you create animations for items that move from point A to point B on a page. Just include rocket.css and rocket.js on your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;font-library&quot;&gt;Font Library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fontlibrary.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fontlibrary-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;fontlibrary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://katydecorah.com/font-library/&quot;&gt;Font Library&lt;/a&gt; to tag and organize Google fonts. If you’re looking for a font that fits a certain feel, this could come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stylestats&quot;&gt;StyleStats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/stylestats.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/stylestats-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;stylestats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have StyleStats check out your CSS and give you an overview of its qualities including size, unique font sizes, all colors listed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;css-shrink&quot;&gt;CSS Shrink&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cssshrink.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cssshrink-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;cssshrink&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless your regular shrink who charges $300 an hour, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cssshrink.com&quot;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; does his work for free, slimming down your CSS and removing un-necessary code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;css-beautifier&quot;&gt;CSS Beautifier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/beautifier.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/beautifier-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;beautifier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your ugly, unformatted CSS and &lt;a href=&quot;http://html.fwpolice.com/css/&quot;&gt;turn it into a masterpiece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spin-kit&quot;&gt;Spin Kit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/loadicon.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/loadicon.gif?resize=882%2C495&quot; alt=&quot;loadicon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could stare at them all day, and nothing’s ever going to load. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/&quot;&gt;Spin Kit&lt;/a&gt; is your source for CSS loading icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;px-to-em-conversion&quot;&gt;PX to EM conversion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/px-em.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/px-em-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;px-em&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Math is hard. &lt;a href=&quot;http://px-em.com/&quot;&gt;PX to EM&lt;/a&gt; will take care of the number crunching for you. Enter your original size and required size and it’ll math it up and give you an EM equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-scale&quot;&gt;Type Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/typescale.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/typescale-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;typescale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How big is that font? &lt;a href=&quot;http://type-scale.com&quot;&gt;It’s big&lt;/a&gt;. How big is the next size up? Bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-svg-font-machine&quot;&gt;The SVG Font Machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/svgfont.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/svgfont-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;svgfont&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn your SVG icons into &lt;a href=&quot;https://glyphter.com&quot;&gt;a usable font&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fontello&quot;&gt;Fontello&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fontello.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fontello-1024x649.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;fontello&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take icon sets from the known joints like Font Awesome and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontello.com&quot;&gt;turn them&lt;/a&gt; into a font.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Post I Wrote with Writed</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/writed/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/writed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m always on the lookout for new and interesting apps that make the desktop writing experience more enjoyable. I’m a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://desk.pm&quot;&gt;Desk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ia.net/writer&quot;&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt; and wondered what other kinds of markdown-based writing tools were out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search turned up more than a few and I only had time to talk about one, tonight, so I picked a free entry in the space, &lt;a href=&quot;http://writed.io&quot;&gt;Writed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a believer of having a good-quality, distraction-free writing environment to craft stories, blog posts, news articles, and even school papers*, one of the biggest things to me is the ability to go full-on distraction-free mode and be able to just write, without anything else getting in the way. Writed does the full-screen writing mode well with several styles to choose from. Since it was night when I wrote this, I found it suitable to sit by a lamp at my desk and use the Night theme. The contrast is good and I’m not struggling to see. Plus, if I darken the brightness of my screen, the dark grey background becomes almost black, and the words still pop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distraction-free&quot;&gt;99% Distraction Free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word and character counter sit at the bottom of the screen, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to make that bar disappear, so strictly speaking, I’m not operating in full distraction-free mode like my favorites would alow me to do, but we’re close. To be honest, I like to see the numbers from time to time because it feels like I’m increasing some magical word score and I’m shooting for a high score. I have this odd fascination with things that allow me to attain exceedingly high scores with no real reward at the end but an even higher score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-markdown-support&quot;&gt;Basic Markdown Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writed does markdown writing well with it’s backtick ( ` ) code support, as well as proper emphasis with single and double-underscore and -asterisk support. Headers and code blocks work fine, as well as blockquoting with greater-than carats ( the &amp;gt; symbol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was going to chang anything about this application, I’d only do one thing: make the bottom bar something I can hide. Given that it’s a slightly different color in the theme, it stands out from the rest of the editing space and is just a smidge distracting. Other than that, I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://writed.io&quot;&gt;Writed&lt;/a&gt; and for the price of FREE with a couple optional in-app purchases, it’s super hard to say no to such an app that gets the basic markdown-centric-distraction-limited-writing-space job done.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Custom Domains on Medium</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/custom-domains-on-medium</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is something I never knew existed. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; team posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-story/custom-domains-for-publications-8cb161d9651&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; back in March about their limited beta launch of custom domains for publications that use Medium as a publishing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article isn’t super detailed about the whole process and there’s only a few publications on board as of the March 12, 2015 story, but this is something I’ve been wanting to see from Medium for a long time. Their publishing platform is awesome. It’s super easy to use and is formatted very well for long-form articles and stories that feature big and beautiful imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only hope is that they extend this to everyone at some point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>After 200 Posts&#8230; What&#8217;s Next?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I published my 200th blog post for the year, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed&quot;&gt;a bit ago&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the free markdown editing app &lt;a href=&quot;http://writed.io&quot;&gt;Writed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s crazy to think that starting in &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/&quot;&gt;January&lt;/a&gt;, up until today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/&quot;&gt;July 9th&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve written 200 blog posts (with this one being #201).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely sure what the next 200 posts will hold, but I hope to be able to get them in before the end of the year. There’s a tad less than 1/2 of the calendar year to go so I’m looking at quite a challenge, but I was able to start strong in the beginning of the year so there’s no excuse why I can’t sit down and bust out 200 different things I want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/08/elder-scrolls/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/08/elder-scrolls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I never thought I’d end up being a fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise. I haven’t so much as played any of the past titles including the ever popular Skyrim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then last weekend, while I was scrolling through the PlayStation Store on my PlayStation 4, I came across Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited. I was naturally a bit curious as I hadn’t followed the franchise much and wanted to know more about this unknown-to-me installment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it wasn’t a new installment at all so much as it was an all-access pass to the Elder Scrolls Online world. Previously, people had to pay monthly for the game like those who play World of Warcraft and MMOs like it. Having a one-time fee of $60 seemed much more appealing to someone like me that might pick it up and put it down here and there and go a significant while without playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I wanted to do at this point in my gaming career (if you can call it that) was to end up spending $15-20 a month on a game that I only play for a few hours a week. The total cost of ownership would be much lower at this single price point, even at the same duration of play per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I caved and bought it. Since it was a digital purchase, I more or less bought rights to play it, but that’s just semantics. I really thought I would be able to pick it up and start playing that same night. As it turns out, that wasn’t quite the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At almost 36GB for the main game and 18GB for the “update” to said game, I was in for a wait. A 55GB game is nothing to sneeze and and that gave me hope there would be a lot of content and a lot of places to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, long after it downloaded, I fired it up and jumped into the fray. This comes after spending a few hours the night before watching YouTube videos to partly learn about what’s going on and partly secretly justify my (probably) non-refundable purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions are important, and I wasn’t really disappointed. The visuals are on par with what I would expect from a current-generation game console at steady frame rates. The story is as fantasy as it can get. The interface took some getting used to as this is my first foray into the console-MMO space. Quest markers were the hardest parts to get down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several hours, I was hooked, however, and am glad I made the purchase. So far, I’ve sunk roughly 10 hours into the game and have just scratched the surface. I look forward to continuing my digital adventures with my character named NathanielIronbow. Cheesy, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Wireless Streaming of Spotify (sort of)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why I didn’t discover this earlier. My excitement when Spotify came to the PlayStation 4 was moderate and I’ve been using Spotify as an all-but-replacement for my rotting Apple iTunes (now Apple Music) library for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I never put together until today is that I can control what’s playing on my PlayStation 4 via Spotify on my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this isn’t news to a lot of people, but it is to me, so you know what…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…mind blown.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackedit.io&quot;&gt;StackEdit&lt;/a&gt; is a in-browser markdown editor that takes on the likes of iA Writer and GitHub Pages in terms of its capability. If you’re a fan of Markdown in even the least bit, it’ll be easy for StackEdit to be your go to text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interface window features the basic text editor and styling controls like text format, linking, inserting code and images, and creating lists. In fact, it’s so easy to pick up, you really don’t need any instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-30-15.57.20.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-30-15.57.20.png?resize=882%2C559&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-06-30 15.57.20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual pane editor/preview layout is like that of the NodeJS-powered Ghost blog platform. Everything you type shows up in real time on the right-hand side of the screen in proper format. When you’re done, you can sync your texts to Dropbox or Google Drive, save them in the editor, and even push them to various end points including Blogger, WordPress, GitHub, Tumblr, and an SSH server if you have your own static site platform you wish to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really cool? If you have a CouchDB instance, it’ll push straight to it. Pretty nifty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackedit.io&quot;&gt;StackEdit&lt;/a&gt; a try. I think you’ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Kitematic Overview</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/27/a-kitematic-overview/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/27/a-kitematic-overview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have only recently started tinkering with Docker when I made a brief attempt at getting Discourse running on my server. What started out as me being quite frustrated with my lack of SMTP knowledge ended in my admittance that a pre-packaged setup would be much easier, and indeed it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker is good for that. Docker’s purpose is to allow swift and efficient deployment and management of applications that reside in their own containers. Think of a cargo ship. Each one of those containers can be its own app that runs exclusively in its own box/bubble/container/virtual world and on the outside Docker and the system it runs on maintains structural integrity so each container can keep running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re relatively new to Docker like I am, you’ll probably be wondering how easy it is to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two routes: the command line route and the GUI route. Today I’m going to show off the GUI route by way of an app called Kitematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-27-16.02.42.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-27-16.02.42.png?resize=882%2C570&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-06-27 16.02.42&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Kitematic, in my opinion, is to bridge the gap that’s created by the learning curve created by not being fully aware of how to interact with Docker on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying an image is dirt simple. The UI presents you with a searchable area in which you can comb the Docker Hub. One click is all it takes to create an instance of the application you’re looking to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual deployment time will depend on your Internet connection speed because the image has to be downloaded. The larger the application, the longer it’ll take to deploy, install, and configure, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deployment-tests&quot;&gt;Deployment Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of apps I downloaded and how long they took from the moment I clicked the Create button to the moment they were ready to go. These incredibly non-scientific numbers come from my 2011 Macbook Pro with a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB of RAM, and the images being stored and run on an SSD. I also used the most popular choices for each of these images, including recommended ones if they were available. Each of the image were downloaded on a 125mbps Internet connection and the timing below includes that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Application&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Time to Ready&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Atlassian JIRA&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1m 45s&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Redis&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0m 12s&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;MySQL&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Nginx&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0m 5s&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Minecraft&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1m 50s&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Jenkins&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1m 16s&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0m 35s&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I obviously want to stress that the above numbers are essentially me using a stopwatch and watching the process take place. When it came to MySQL, it never fully initialized and I was unable to determine its progress after about 30 seconds. I couldn’t connect to the service and the logs weren’t displaying anything. It’s possible that I just got a bad run and re-doing it could have fixed my issue. YMMV.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan on running Kitematic a lot, you’ll want to make sure you can reserve at least 2GB of RAM for the VirtualBox VM it runs in the background. Also, check Kitematic’s settings and check the box to clean up the VM on closure if you’re on a battery-powered system. It’ll take a bit of extra time on boot but it’ll save your battery when you’re not using it, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe it’s prudent to point out that if you choose the delete-on-closure option, you might find yourself with a VM that can’t fetch an IP address when you re-start Kitematic. This was the case 100% of the time I restarted Kitematic after killing VirtualBox on Kitematic’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s where I tell you if it’s worth it. In short, completely. For people like me that just want to get things done and move on with my day and not have to deal with the command line all the time, this is a boon. If you’re a die-hard command line junkie that thrives on typos and mashing away at the keyboard, go do it the regular, old-fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitematic is free to use and is in Beta. It might be a bit rough around the edges, and may not work very well on Windows. I tried running the JIRA install on Windows and it failed every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to break into Docker and the idea of containered apps, this is your vice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Check Yourself</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/26/check-yourself/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/26/check-yourself</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TAKE IT FROM ME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to give advice. It’s actually way too easy. Standing on the outside, looking in, it’s easy to observe, to judge. We compare someone and the pieces that make them whole to ourselves and our own components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we fail to do all too often is heed our own advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;do as I say, not as I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those words were likely spoken by every parent to ever exist even so far as millennia past. We secretly swear but tell our children that such acts are bad. We teach that good [religious group] should regularly [reglion-based activity] but we fail to even keep par with the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sit here in front of my screen and bang on the keyboard in an attempt to preach to you about how you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/life-changes/&quot;&gt;create better habits&lt;/a&gt; and how you should do that extra good thing every day and how you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/naturebox/&quot;&gt;stop shoveling shit&lt;/a&gt; for food into your grub hole every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d be a damn hypocrite if I did that. There’s a fine line between sharing good ideas and things that sound like they’d be worthwhile and preaching them as gospel and it’s hard to see when initially observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it from me. There are times when I want to tell the world how awesome it is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half/&quot;&gt;get up early&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, sit down, and kick some creative ass, all before breakfast, except I can’t manage to do that, myself, right now. So I don’t. I use to. I used to tout how awesome it was, regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, though, I did it. Every single day. I woke up between 3:30 and 4:00 A.M., hopped in the shower, made coffee, and sat down with enough time for almost an hour of un-interrupted creativity and morning reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;take care of your own yard before you start criticizing your neighbor’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to tout what I don’t follow or believe, myself. I think it’s important to &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/on-accepting/&quot;&gt;nut up or shut up&lt;/a&gt;. I know &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/&quot;&gt;struggling&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt; is real. I’ve discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/&quot;&gt;creativity&lt;/a&gt; comes to those who &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/&quot;&gt;hunt it down&lt;/a&gt; like a rabid wolf hunts a juicy deer. I know what it’s like to &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/&quot;&gt;have your mind&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/&quot;&gt;wrong place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I know &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/incapacity/&quot;&gt;making excuses&lt;/a&gt; is for the weak. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/professional-life-liver/&quot;&gt;professional&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/magic/&quot;&gt;make an excuse&lt;/a&gt;. Take it from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Accepting</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/25/on-accepting/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/25/on-accepting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a perpetual battle that takes place every day. This battle involves everything around you, your life, your hobbies, your friends, and your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This battle isn’t really a battle at all. It’s a dance. A tango, of sorts. We wake up in the morning and it’s time to dance. We lay our heads down at night and only after we close our eyes and drift into dreamland do we stop the motions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From those words, it should be at least a step down from completely confusing what I’m referring to. If you’re not a mind-reader, or you haven’t skipped ahead, I don’t hold it against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m talking about is satisfaction… being content with the things you have… the people you know… the amount of money you make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me get this out there right now before I continue: I’m not saying you shouldn’t push for that raise or buy a new car to replace your current mode of transportation or anything of the sort. What I’m talking about is knowing when to gun for greatness and when to sit and be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last four years, a lot in my life has changed. The biggest change in my life was when I got married. My wife has been and will always be the biggest blessing to me. Beside her, there’ve been a host of other life changes (also known as obstacles) and there have been improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every so often, we move. This has been the case, historically, since 2011. So far as I can count, in the last four years, we’ve lived in five apartments of our own and one belonging to friends, including the one we live in, now. Each move has led us to a progressively better living situation, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are times when we’ve taken lateral steps and most currently, we took a half-step backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about downgrading to living with other people or on the street or having to move back home. We picked a less-than-ideal neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had good reason, however. It was April, myy wife was slated to start graduate school at the end of the summer, our existing lease was set to end at the end of May, and I received a job offer that required us to move sooner rather than later, with later being the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only had a few weeks to find a place to live. The money wasn’t unlimited so we couldn’t take our sweet time. Based on information we found online (apartment hunting), we found a place that looked decent. We had no idea what the neighborhood would be like because we had never been there before and were pretty new to the Bay Area in general. Our last visit was almost an indirect one as we played tourists and visited Golden Gate Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we move in, we come to find that perhaps our decision was a bit rushed, but it was too late to do anything about it, now. We were already there. We spent two days moving 900 miles and couldn’t return home. We also couldn’t shore up somewhere until we figured out a better living situation. We discovered our neighborhood wasn’t the best, as some would call Hayward, CA &lt;em&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe they were right. I, for one, love Mexican food, so there’s no harm in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it’s not the safest area, either. I’ll admit that the large gates and high walls around our apartment building signify more than just styling choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a little crime-free oasis. While it might not be ideal, it’s working out for us, right now, and we’re OK with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that, it all comes down to accepting what we have and learning to cope. Sure, we could move out, and we probably will at some point, but until that time comes, there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s time to suck it up and deal with our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I regret the decision to move to the East Bay? No. Do I regret any of the decisions I’ve made in recent history? Absolutely not. Why? Because I’ve accepted them. I accepted the fact that I defaulted on a credit card one time, or I spent too much money on something I didn’t need. Fuck it. Life happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all make mistakes and decide to travel the less than ideal path. However, when we’re faced with two decisions were neither are perfect, we suck it up and pick one. It’s the whole life-giving-you-lemons thing. We have a ton of lemonade to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t take my story as me saying I just gave up and decided that complacency is the best path to choose. That’s not at all the case. The path I code is one of more careful planning, better allocation of resources and making more informed decisions. I’m choosing to do take the slow road so I can spend the time to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to making a life-changing decision, do you jump down off the roof onto the ground head first or feet first?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two nights ago, I convinced my team to pick up Slack. I wanted them to stop slacking on effective communication and while I can cut them some slack on being in different time zones, there’s no excuse with today’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about all I have for Slack puns and euphemisms. We’ve been using Slack for about 48 hours now and we’re loving it. I think I might be loving it the most because I championed the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its super low barrier for entry (free!) it wasn’t hard for us to pick it up and give it a go. My team is only twelve people but I think we’ve communicated more via text than we’ve communicated via Lync and email in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I described it in our meeting as IRC for this decade, but it’s a lot more than that and I’m striving to find ways to expand the service for my people as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, I’m the Senior Technical Support Lead for Zephyr’s Americas support team. That puts me at second in command and makes me responsible for my teams success. One struggle I’ve seen is keeping effective lines of communication open between each staff member and creating open dialog about technical and customer-facing issues we encounter on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really didn’t have any sort of real-time collaboration going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I brought in Slack. I can see who’s available, strike up conversations with them, discuss particular issues in channels, and get notified from various other systems right away, without having to leave Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found out about support requests faster through Slack than by staring at ZenDesk all day (our ticketing system). Getting notifications on all my devices at the same time about what’s happening as its happening is a boon for me and that only drives my desire to integrate more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that bothers me though is autocomplete requires some fancy service on the other end in order to work. I don’t want to sit down and write middleware to tie into Slack so I can shorthand with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/slash&lt;/code&gt; command. I should be able to say &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ticket 12345&lt;/code&gt; prints in chat &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://ticket.system/12345&lt;/code&gt;. I don’t see what’s so hard about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webhooks are super cool though and being able to touch them with 3rd party service and update my channels with relevant information is awesome. Being able to be notified in real time about anything that’s happening in another system with minimal code change is sweet. All our custom apps can push notifications, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even well-known 3rd party services can integrate well. Some leave things to be desired like my ZenDesk-Slack integration, but I can’t blame Slack for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a service that’s had next to no marketing done and has survived on majority word of mouth and small advertisements here and there, Slack is killing it in the real-time collaboration space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone on my team suggested we look at HipChat, too… is it bad that I sort of don’t want to?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Waiting for Inspiration</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parapublishing.com/sites/para/about/danpoynter.cfm&quot;&gt;Dan Poynter&lt;/a&gt; once said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you wait for inspiration to write; you’re not a writer, you’re a waiter.I, for one, would hate to work in food service. My wife did that for a while and she hated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding inspiration is hard, which is why I don’t like looking for it. To say it takes a lot of effort to figure out what to write about is to say it takes a lot of time to figure out that you want to wear something that looks good on your body, today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m always looking for new places to discover great services and products. Last night Crozdesk followed me on Twitter and I couldn’t help but check them out and see what they offer. Really, I check out just about anyone that follows me on twitter. I’m by no means a superstar on the social network so I have time for things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crozdesk is a place to find a company, service, or product offering to fulfill a need you might have in various spaces, be it web design, hosting, social media, marketing, or anything relatively similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their offering list is small-ish but I see it growing quickly as there’s no charge for submitting your product or service to the site. If you’re an indie developer or a small startup that has something cool, this would be the place to share it and let the community rate and offer their opinion on it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to tinker with Discourse for a while, now. It’s used at several of my favorite sites for their communities so I found it reasonable to try it out for myself and see how it works out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My end goal was to use it as a comment replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I get there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think so…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Creativity</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/19/creativity-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I’m sitting here, pondering what to write about. I’ve been a terrible person, not sticking to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know me at all, you’ll know it is indeed a chaotic scene when there’s no plan and I’m involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Pressfield is one of my new favorite authors and his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1G234yc&quot;&gt;Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt; speaks great truths about what it takes to transition from average joe doing some crap somewhere to becoming a professional and doing what you really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a small passage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1G234yc&quot;&gt;Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt; that fits well in today’s post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Twelve-step programs say: “One day at a time.” The professional says the same thing.He’s right though. I could sit here and ramble about how I can’t figure out anything to write, how my creativity is available for just a moment, and how planning out a crazy level of future posts would be fruitless and a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I said all that, it would be true. Sitting here thinking about planning out content makes me tired and want to just watch HBO (which I plan on doing after I finish writing this, anyway). Planning isn’t going to bring creativity. Inspiration is just a trigger for creativity. I could sit and stare out my window at the street and get inspiration creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a million ways to come up with an idea, but the best one is the one where you take it one step at a time, one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Keeping Score</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/16/keeping-score/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/16/keeping-score</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to start a project for the wrong reason. It’s because of this reason that I ended up giving up said project for the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I had it all figured out. I carved out time on my calendar, I made plans, I had an idea…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the measurement for success in this project was grossly incorrect, and I realized it a couple days ago when I picked up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936891034/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1936891034&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=johnatlymanco-20&amp;amp;linkId=SQZD7GW7YIX5GIY5&quot;&gt;Steven Pressfield’s Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I never finished the book, so I felt it was appropriate to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this passage and it really hit home surrounding this project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The real utility of money is its convenience as a medium of exchange. If you and I have a goat in Smyrna, we don’t have to carry the poor beast in our arms all the way to Aleppo to trade it for a carpet. We can sell the goat in Smyrna, stash a silver dairy in our pocket, then take the dairy to Aleppo to buy the carpet.But when we’re addicted to money, we become hooked on the metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is money how we keep score? Is it magic? Is wealth a currency that opens doors, realizes possibilities, produces transcendence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Turning Pro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case… it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I could craft this project and end up getting rich quick. I’ve seen enough documentaries on how that’s never the case but yet I thought otherwise. When my project started, I got a huge influx of traffic to it and I thought it was going to be smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the traffic died off, and everyone left. Not a sole gave a damn. I was hoping they’d throw their digital selves at me in the form of coming back or contributing, but they didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make money off this project. I wanted it to become a full-time thing. I didn’t think about the other battle I was waging that would ultimately affect this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing sight of what’s most important in any project is common and while sometimes it’s recoverable, other times, there’s no way to go but to the bitter end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I canceled my subscriptions to all the things necessary to keep it running. It’ll die in a few days, and that’s OK by me. It shouldn’t have ever lived. I wasn’t ready for it and I made a Frankenstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning experiences can be tough sometimes, but when you’re keeping score for all the wrong reasons, it’s bound to happen… and it should. It keeps reality in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead, I’m focusing on what’s most important and fulfilling for me. I need to keep my head in as few places as possible, while still getting enough stimulation to keep myself fresh and mentally alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many outlets can lead to burn out, even if all said outlets are appealing. Sometimes, going back to the basics is exactly what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Incapacity</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/16/incapacity/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/16/incapacity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What do you think of when I say that amateurs look for excuses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a rhetorical question and I don’t expect an answer. Instead, that sentence should really be a statement. It’s an obvious one to someone who’s paying attention, but on the inside, it’s harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as the easy way out, looking to find a way out of a tough situation by copping out or giving up is modus operandi of those who can’t hack it. Amateurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about people who aren’t good enough at a specific thing. No one should expect to be experts at everything they do. What I’m talking about is life. Sticking with the shit that comes your way. Dealing with less than ideal situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever first said “shit happens” is the realist realist the world will ever experience. One thing a professional understands is that sometimes you step in it, but the best route is to clean it off and keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea became one I find myself gravitating towards after reading a relevant passage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1G234yc&quot;&gt;Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The habits and addictions of the amateur are…self-inflicted wounds…[Amateurs] no longer have to face the real fight of our lives, which is to become who we are and to realize our destiny and our calling.That’s not some hippie shit from a guy smoking weed. That’s real talk from a guy who used to be an amateur. If you’ve ever thought about reading what it takes to rock life and kick it’s ass, he’s the guy to go to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about this: how easy is it to make an excuse? It just slips right on out there without anyone noticing… except you… time and again… uttering the same garbage… because you can’t accept the fact you failed at something… or many somethings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pro would admit wrong and rectify it. Today. Right freaking now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also don’t see pros telling their boss they didn’t have time to create that presentation that’s due today, even though all they did was sit on Reddit and bitch about their boss. An amateur is quick to make excuses for themselves to protect their mediocrity and constant state of incapacitation of potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a small resolution to kick ass this year, and this is one of the many ways to do it because 2015 isn’t quite over. I don’t have to relocate my foot in someone’s ass physically, to rock my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many ways it starts is by accepting the challenge that lays in front of me, every day. Each moment, there’s a hurdle, and each moment I can jump or smash into it like a lumbering blob of crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter doesn’t sound so appealing, does it…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Cost of Cutting the Cord</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/07/cost-of-cutting-the-cord/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/07/cost-of-cutting-the-cord</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People talk about “cutting the cord” a.k.a canceling their Cable or Satellite service and opting for internet-based services. One thing that doesn’t seem to get a whole lot of coverage, in my opinion, is the cost of cutting the cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this might be a bit biased because of circumstances, I wanted to compare what I’m paying every month for Comcast and how much it would cost to cut it out and switch to online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the breakdown. When it comes to single-purchase items, we’ll divide it up over 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comcast Xfinity Double Play:&lt;/strong&gt; $125/month (after taxes/fees)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtract Internet Serivce:&lt;/strong&gt; x 50%&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Cable Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $62.50So we have $62.50 to work with. Let’s start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netflix:&lt;/strong&gt; $9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hulu+:&lt;/strong&gt; $9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SlingTV (plus add ons to match):&lt;/strong&gt; $20 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;HBONow&lt;/strong&gt;** :** $15&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HD Antenna (for locals):&lt;/strong&gt; $40/12 = $3.33 &lt;strong&gt;Total:&lt;/strong&gt; $76.33&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the cost for subscribing the same speed Internet package as a standalone service will add as much as $40/month on top of the Internet half of the above $125. All in all, we’re looking at $176.33 to match what I already have. That doesn’t seem like much of a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear about a couple things: I aimed high on purpose. Not everyone would need everything and maybe if you only watch a few channels, you’d be able to save some money. However, Internet-only packages are expensive and unless you’re okay with the bare minimum speed from your provider, you’re going to end up paying quite a bit which really doesn’t make it worth it, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need to say that I watch a lot of variety of television programming in addition to the simple stuff that’s easy to access via one of the above services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps at some point when Internet-only prices come down, this might make sense, but adding an extra $50 to “cut the cord” that I still use for Internet doesn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/06/get-your-gear-out</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Historically, the weekends have been hard on my hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a photographer that I follow on an occasional basis, mainly because his typical subjects aren’t necessarily family friendly. His name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattgranger.com&quot;&gt;Matt Granger&lt;/a&gt;. He has a saying that I’m finding myself stuck to more now than ever: “Get Your Gear Out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s right. I need to. If I call myself a landscape photographer, why is my camera gear sitting in my bag all the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a couple locations I want to visit this weekend that are relatively close by (one is just down the street, actually). I’m looking forward to what I can capture this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three Things I Wish I Did Sooner</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/05/three-things/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/05/three-things</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I could make this list a mile long, literally, but hindsight is always 20/20 and there’s a load of things we wish we could do differently. In this case, I’m paring this list down to three things that while I wish I would have done sooner, are not too late to start, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-to-code&quot;&gt;Learn to Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one thing I wish I would have started a lot sooner, and is probably by far the highest on my list, and plays a lot into my other two wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered the software development game much later than a lot of my peers who are already developers of various capacities. I didn’t get any formal programming experience until the end of 2013. I had an opportunity to transition into it full time and I should have taken it. Instead, I opted not to because I wasn’t thinking about my future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great job, that could have been even better had I paid attention. Instead, I lost it due to attrition and without a doubt I believe that had I chose door number one instead, I would have likely stayed on and worked there for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m basically starting from the beginning. I know how to write Python and I can understand just about any code I read, but I’m not a programmer. I wouldn’t mind being one, but I have yet to understand the fundamentals, even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a free course from the University of Michigan via Coursera on Python and I hope this gives me some foundation on software development. I’m not ready to learn a massive language, yet. I need to master the basics, first, and Python is a great language (in my opinion) to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consider-education-important&quot;&gt;Consider Education Important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I didn’t give two shits about it, and if future me could have gone back and punched at-the-time current me in the face every time I was being stupid, I would have had a black eye on a weekly basis. Because I gave so little thought to my education at the time, I barely made it out in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the ability to go on to a great college and probably not have to pay for it. I could have done something awesome with my time. I figure I’d have a masters degree in something awesome I like and be doing something totally different, probably related to wish #1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as people say college can be a waste of time and money, I firmly believe that if you point your energy in the right direction, and get a meaningful degree in something that can turn into a long-lasting career, then spend away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’m about six years behind the boat. I’m in college, now, but I wasn’t expecting it to take this long. Fortunately, with the advent of online programs, I’m working on a degree in something meaningful that I enjoy and am still able to have a life and a job, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spend-more-time-on-hobbies&quot;&gt;Spend More Time on Hobbies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had spent more time on hobbies that I found interesting in the last five or so years. I only have a few hobbies I really enjoy, but I only spent enough time on them for them to remain just interesting enough to partake in on an occasional basis. One of these hobbies is photography. I know that if I set my mind to it, I could do great things in that space, but even to this day I still fight with the idea of “I can do it later” and then boom you’re moving out of state and that giant list of places you wanted to photograph in Washington are now out of reach for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a big list of places in Washington State that I never got to photograph. It’s no one’s fault but mine. I’m physically capable of making all the necessary preparations and treks to those spots. I was just too lazy and sitting at home playing video games sounded fun at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that everything has settled down here in California, this is something I’m devoting more time to. I really enjoy shooting and getting some time to enjoy nature, so now I have no excuses. I’m starting to plan out my adventures on my schedule and am going to stick to them just like I plan on sticking to everything else on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;——————————————-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, there are a lot of things I would likely have to give up if my life had played out differently, and knowing what I know now about them, I can’t say I’d be okay with that. For starters, I probably would have never met my wife and she’s my best friend. I can’t say that I’d give her up for more programming experience, a larger photography portfolio or a higher grade point average in high school. Those things are all relative and while they have impacts on the future, their effects can still be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time for a Reset</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/05/reset/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/05/reset</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be honest: it’s been hard to keep up with blogging regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been nineteen days since I last posted something of meaning. This is unacceptable. I used to write every day. This was when my work schedule forced me to be up earlier in the morning so I added an hour onto it and started writing at 4am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current schedule shifted to later in the day with not needing to be at work for a couple more hours. This has put a damper on my morning blogging sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we moved, it became almost impossible to wake up early in the morning to write. I have yet to do it after almost two complete months. It’s quite disappointing, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I averaged in 50-70,000 words a month back then. Sure they weren’t cohesive enough to be considered book worthy, but they added up to a book’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, under 200 words, and I’m frustrated. This is the first time I’ve personally blogged in June. By now, I would have had a good 400 posts. I averaged 2-4 per day on most days so it could have been even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to get back to the core of why I started writing. I started my blog in the beginning of the year as an outlet. Sometimes my posts were long, sometimes they were short. Sometimes they inspired, sometimes people hated them. You can tell all that yourself by looking for the ones with comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it would seem that blogging every morning again is going to be a bit difficult, I’m going to shoot for it anyway. What’s the worst that could happen? I don’t have anything riding on this. No pressures of any kind. I don’t make money with this blog. I have yet to see a single dime from the words on this site, and that’s how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little help from my latest task management tool, 2Do, I’m going to start blogging every morning, again, including the weekends. This time, I’m not setting any rules. I created a bunch of parameters the last time I did this in January and they worked well because I blew right past them. This told me they didn’t serve any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a goal parameter problem. I can write an essay’s worth of words in 30 minutes, for crying out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lazy-ass problem. I’ll admit it. Sometimes, I’m lazy as shit. I guarantee you my alarm will go off at 5:00AM tomorrow morning and I’ll tell myself it can wait a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it can’t, because that’s how I ended up in this slump in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to resetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how this goes!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Beginner&#8217;s Mind</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/22/beginners-mind/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/22/beginners-mind</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It happens to all of us. We get worked up about something that we’re really confident is a for sure thing. Then they call the lottery numbers and we’re still broke. Being disappointed by or in something extends way beyond buying lottery tickets and hoping to strike it rich. It’s easy to be disappointed in just about anything when we realize it didn’t meet our original goals or expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I read a post from Marc Chernoff on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marcandangel.com/2015/05/13/3-ways-youre-making-your-life-harder-than-it-has-to-be/?utm_content=buffer0b89b&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot;&gt;3 Ways You’re Making Your Life Harder Than It Has To Be&lt;/a&gt;. While not directly related to this discussion, one of the things he points out is this situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Imagine you had a ripe, juicy apple sitting on an otherwise empty table in front of you.  You pick it up eagerly, take a nibble, and begin to taste it.You already know how an apple should taste, and so when this one is a bit more tart than you expected, you make a face, feel a sense of disappointment and swallow it, dissatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the apple tastes EXACTLY as you expected – nothing special at all.  So you swallow without even pausing to enjoy its flavor, and you move on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first scenario, the apple was disappointing because it didn’t meet your expectations.  In the second, it was too plain and unexciting because it met your expectations to a T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see the irony here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s either not good, or not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about that for a second. In this scenario, the consumer of the apple is inherently disappointed because the apple was either nothing remarkable or just sucked. Both are levels of disappointment, the former being veiled and not all-encompassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to avoid so much disappointment in life is to go into things with and open mind. The other, stop having expectations for things you aren’t intimately familiar with and be &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt;. I can walk into Whole Foods and subsequently walk out and be disappointed they don’t have a certain brand of something I want. I could also walk into Whole Foods and buy an alternative brand to something I want because the original brand wasn’t available. In the latter situation, I’m no longer disappointed I couldn’t get X product. Sure it wasn’t the brand I wanted, but I went into Whole Foods with the idea that it might not actually be there in the uber-specific format I desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In consuming the apple from earlier, Marc goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now imagine you try this: eliminate your expectations of how the apple ‘should’ taste.  You don’t know, and you don’t pretend to know, because you haven’t tried it yet.  Instead, you’re genuinely curious, impartial and open to a variety of flavors.You taste it, and you truly pay attention.  You notice the juiciness, the grainy texture of the skin, the simultaneously sweet, tangy and tart flavors swirling around your tongue, and all the other complex sensations that arise in your awareness as you chew.  You didn’t know how it would taste, but now you realize it’s brilliant!  It’s brand new, because you’ve never tasted THIS apple before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness practitioners often refer to this as “beginner’s mind,” but really it’s just the outcome of a mindset free of needless expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginner’s Mind. All of this boils down to having a beginner’s mind. Going into a situation without pretense, already being convinced, or otherwise having a jaded view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called “keeping an open mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Forget Your Goals</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/07/forget-goals/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/07/forget-goals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All through life we set goals for yourselves in order to accomplish things. Sometimes we set a goal to lose 20 pounds by summer, or to finish fixing cleaning up the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spend so much time focusing on the end, that while we make our way there, we never feel like the actions in the middle are as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, they are. In fact, they’re more important than the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the example of losing 20 pounds. That sounds like a fantastic idea, one that I could probably get behind, myself. The problem with this idea is that all that seems to be important is crossing the 20-pounds-lost mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re so focused on the end, we don’t believe everything we’re doing in between is crucial, too, and end up not giving it as much attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a better example that I can take from my personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started this blog January 2015, I’ve shared 74,000 words. For comparison, 60-80,000 words is a book. I wrote a book in a sliver over four months. If I woke up, January 1, 2015, and set a goal to write a book and have it finished by May 7th, I’d freak out. I’d also probably not finish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In climbing to 74,000 words, I focused on the day-to-day. I set writing goals for myself that didn’t involve an endgame. These plans I made didn’t have a finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I came to realize then what I realize now, I wouldn’t have even called them goals. What’s a good word for something you do on a regular basis for which you set aside time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project? a habit? It could be called anything you want, so long as you find these criteria to be most important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out what you want to accomplish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set aside time at whatever interval you find appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t think about #1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do whatever it is you planned on doing during the time set at #2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat #3 and #4 as necessary until you’re where you want to be.
The first step comes in the planning phase. This is where you sit down and determine what you want to do. Maybe you really do want to lose 20 pounds. It’s totally okay to have that goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step two involves figuring out when during the week you’re going to sit down (or stand up) and work on the task at hand. Depending on what it is, you can break it down in to multiple sub-tasks. If you’re writing a book, each time you sit down and write can be a task all on its own; write a page every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step three is the most important of all: stop thinking about your end goal. Seriously. Everything I’m telling you comes down to this: if you focus only on the end, you’ll never appreciate all the work you’re doing to get there. That 1.2 pounds you lost last week will seem like nothing and you’ll eat your sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step four is action time. You’ve determined when you’re going to work, so now work. Enter into the work mindset with the idea that you’re just there to complete the task. You’re only doing whatever it is you’re doing at that time. You entered the gym and are going to lift weights. You’re training for a marathon but tonight you’re only going to focus on running five miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step five involves continuing to work and not focusing on your end goal. Tracking progress can be acceptable but is a slippery slope. If you’re just starting out, I wouldn’t recommend it. If your goal is open-ended, then by all means. Tracking progress on an open-ended goal is great. It forces you to think about it in smaller chunks because there’s no end, only continual betterment of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to tell you to stop having goals. Having a goal or five is awesome and I encourage it. It’s the focus and or obsession over said goal that’s the problem. I keep going back to the 20-pounds-lost goal because it’s such a good one to use as an example. In order to lose 20 pounds, you have to lose one pound, then two pounds. Then three. If nothing I say but one sentence sticks, let it be this one: what you’re doing today to reach your goals in life is more important than reaching the actual goal because without those incremental steps, you’ll never make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;————&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is there a goal in life you’re trying to accomplish but don’t feel like you can ever make it? What do you think would happen if you stopped focusing on the end and started paying attention to what you’re doing about it right now? I’d love to hear your story in the comments, via twitter &lt;a href=&quot;//twitter.com/theeJL&quot;&gt;@theeJL&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;. If your story is good, I might revisit this topic in a future post with your thoughts and comments. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Morning Email: Check In Without Checking Out</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/06/morning-email/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/06/morning-email</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever worked in a position where regular communication via email is important, you know what I’m about to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all guilty of it. It’s 8:00 AM. You’ve sat down at your desk, your computer is warming up for the day. You open your email application and BOOM, there’s a metric butt load of emails waiting for you, nay pining for you, nay downright stabbing each other for your attention. The red bangs, the forty replies from a large group, the attachments, oh God the attachments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisguillebeau.com/never-check-email-in-the-morning/&quot;&gt;great article by Chris Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon about how he finds a way to check his email every morning, but doesn’t let it consume him. How could this be? Only wizards hold such power as to deflect the mind-controlling gaze of a full inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I check email every morning—not always “first thing” but usually pretty early. I take a &lt;strong&gt;quick scan&lt;/strong&gt; , delete or archive anything irrelevant, and send any urgent replies. This quick scan takes an average of 10-15 minutes on average. [emphasis mine]Quick scan. That’s the key. Unless its from HR telling you your giant raise came through or your boss telling you your giant pay cut came through, it can probably wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisguillebeau.com/never-check-email-in-the-morning/&quot;&gt;Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; goes on to talk about the post-email-check session. After checking his email, he starts work. Real work. Stuff he actually has to get done. Those emails are just sitting there, and that’s perfectly okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not jump to conclusions, though. It’s fine to come back to emailing every now and then, but don’t let it become a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit down and complete a full task before checking email again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this on a regular basis. It irritated former co-workers who were still stuck in 1999 and email seemed to be the only way to get a hold of me, never mind that IM, text, phone calls, or God forbid, a desk visit were also viable options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Did you get my email? – Every co-worker who uses email as an excuse to start a conversation about said email’s topic.I want to take Chris’ ideas one step further, though. I think it’s important to set clear boundaries. Establish yourself as that guy in the office who will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address every message at some point throughout the day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between X and Y hours, you will review all messages as necessary. Between those times of your choosing, you’re doing other stuff. Feel free to even close your email program. It’ll all still be there. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak with you in the appropriate manner regarding a message or multiple messages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive a group mail about donuts in the kitchen, promptly punch* the sender with a donut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(* in your mind. Assault is assault, people.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell you to “see me” if it’s really that damn important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re in the same work area, Bob, for crying out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promptly turn you away if you’re coming to talk about an email you just sent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were going to come talk to me, why did you bother sending the email? “For your records” is a lame excuse. Stop it. I’ll come see you if it’s warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how I survive my day. My last job involved a lot of this. I received roughly 20,000 emails a calendar year. Anything short of extreme distance from the Inbox from Hell resulted in a mental breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s your turn. How do you keep from getting distracted, sucked in, and ultimately overwhelmed by email? Share in the comments, below! &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/email-email-447458_1920.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Bored of the Sun</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/06/bored-of-the-sun/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/06/bored-of-the-sun</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to be bored of the sun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s not that I’m bored of seeing the sun every day. Maybe it’s that I’m just drying out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’re probably well aware, &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/about/&quot;&gt;I’m from Seattle&lt;/a&gt;. I grew up in the Seattle metro area and spent my entire life there. Only recently did I &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/moving-to-cali/&quot;&gt;end up moving&lt;/a&gt;. Of all places I could have moved, I landed in Northern California. I did so because the next phase in my wife’s professional life was upon her and it’s only fair that &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/being-a-great-leader/&quot;&gt;I support her&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support/&quot;&gt;She supports me&lt;/a&gt; on a daily basis, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-4/&quot;&gt;moved into&lt;/a&gt; our apartment on April 7. Since then, it’s rained twice for roughly a total of 1.75 inches. As of today, we’ve been here a month… 30 days to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it was April?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I come from, 1.75” is a weekly thing in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in California. Apparently we’re all going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/04/1318778/-California-is-dying-of-thrist-while-it-uses-much-of-its-precious-water-to-raise-livestock-in-China&quot;&gt;die of thirst&lt;/a&gt;, if the media is to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People keep asking me if I’m enjoying the nice weather. I tell them I am, because it’s true. I’m really enjoying not having to wear a jacket all the time. I’m enjoying being able to wear shorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the weather might be boring me. I’m not really bored of the sun, per se, just bored of the same thing every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, Seattle gets a lot more rain and many I’m sure would argue that having “blah” for weather nine months out of the year sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which it does. But it doesn’t happen all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I write this, I’m starting to ponder the idea that maybe it’s not even that I’m bored of seeing the same thing every day when I look out the window. Maybe it’s that I’m just not used to seeing the same blue sky every day in April and May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of weather typically showed up in July in Seattle. That’s my birthday month. It’s a good time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April’s been historically miserable outside. May is so-so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some changing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to keep this tan going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to embrace the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Being a Great Leader Means Being Genuinely Interested</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/05/being-a-great-leader/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/05/being-a-great-leader</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was reading a &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/children-over-soccer/&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; from Indie &lt;a href=&quot;//desk.pm&quot;&gt;software developer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;//john.do&quot;&gt;blogger John Saddington&lt;/a&gt; this evening about a story relating to being a soccer coach for a youth team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good story and like a lot of what he shares, there was a life lesson to be had. One particular sentence stood out to me the most and it’s the one that I kept thinking about even after I finished reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/children-over-soccer/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The reality was that the children needed coaches who loved them,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/love-play/&quot;&gt;who loved watching them play&lt;/a&gt;, and who wanted to continue to &lt;strong&gt;concretely encourage them to pursue the sport beyond their current age bracket&lt;/strong&gt;. [emphasis mine]That last bit in bold really stuck with me and made me think about where I’ve worked in the past and what I’m doing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I’ve worked a variety of IT-related positions but none of them really pushed me to continue to do more. I felt I had to do the pushing myself because the job wasn’t ultimately going to lead to a career. At one point, I had made that such a thing that when I opted to not push, things didn’t go according to plan. Hindsight was definitely 20/20 on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present now, I’m in a position where I can make an impact on someone on a regular basis. Part of my day-to-day is not just pointing a team of talented people in the right direction in their day-to-day work, but pointing them in the right direction  &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; pushing them in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be a good great leader, one has to be willing to invest in the betterment of his or her team. I have a particular friend who works for a broadcasting company that on a regular basis takes time and effort out of their day to provide resources and insight so their team can turn their careers into something they’ll really enjoy, even if the end result isn’t working with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I technically work in customer service but it’s so much more than that. I also work in employee service. I’m not just a Senior Technical Support Lead, I’m a Senior Team Betterment Lead, a Leader in Career Development, and a Master of Taking the Next Step. It’s important to take time and pursue other people’s goals with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perfect example of that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/moving-to-cali/&quot;&gt;moving to California&lt;/a&gt;. I picked up my career and left an area I grew up in so &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support/&quot;&gt;my wife&lt;/a&gt; can grow in herself and her career. I created a very real opportunity for her by putting what I wanted in second place. Similarly in the professional world, I would rather watch a member of my team grow and move on to something better than have them stay in the same job that would otherwise end up being a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If by the end of our time together I’ve been able to give you the tools you need to expand and grow and take that next step in your career, then I’ve done my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Choosing Your Words</title>

   <updated>2015-05-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/04/choosing-your-words</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We spend a great deal of time communicating via text. Some would argue we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizzuka.com/company-blog/we-never-talk-any-more-why-text-messaging-has-replaced-the-phone-for-communication&quot;&gt;communicate more now than ever&lt;/a&gt; before as a society, albeit a smaller percentage via speech. This is likely due to the proliferation of text-based communication methods like email, text messages, Skype, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, before email we wrote letters or talked on the phone. The problem with letter writing is that its not efficient for long conversations. We resorted to the phone for such things but even then a successful phone call required two people to be in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With today’s digital communication, we can say what we want instantly to another person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a downside to all this, however, and I think Mark Twain made a good point well before digital communication was ever a thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The difference between the almost right word and the right work is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. ~ Mark TwainTwain’s statement can be conveyed in two ways: the way related to writing and being descriptive in said writing, likely for a book or short story, and the way related to making sure you mean what you say and say only what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have such instant access to communication, it’s easier than ever to say things without really meaning them. One can be incredibly hurtful and do real damage with little effort. It’s easy to “fly off the handle” at someone via text message because there isn’t a physical barrier preventing those words from instantly reaching someone. In the letter-writing or even telegraph days, one had to think about what they were saying before and during the writing phase. They then had to take that letter or telegraph somewhere to have it sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this extra time serves as a good buffer period. With text messages, however, the moment one becomes upset at another, it takes two seconds to convey that anger and not give it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where we as a society are lacking. We’ve developed ways of near-instantaneous communications with one another tens, hundreds, and thousands of miles away with next to no cost, but we’ve regressed sharply when it comes to what we say and how we say it. We see politicians “walking back” statements they make, we see hateful things written about others on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/12/new-harassment-policy-for-twitter/383344/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/116326365118751&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, we Snapchat our friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=snapchat+photo+leanks&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8#rls=en&amp;amp;q=snapchat+photo+leaks&quot;&gt;pictures that weren’t meant to be shared&lt;/a&gt; without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can’t help but wonder what Mark Twain would say if he saw how careless we as a people have become when choosing our words.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Create High-Resolution Mockups for Your App or Site with Promotee</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/03/create-mockups-promotee/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/03/create-mockups-promotee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to promoting your site or app, it’s important that your renders are high quality and accurately portray what your customers should expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Promotee is a Mac application to create pixel-perfect and professional looking artwork for iOS, Mac and Android apps. Just drop a screenshot from your app onto a template in Promotee and our graphics engine will blend it into the template to generate a gorgeous looking result.Promotee has one goal: to do exactly what I said without breaking the bank of paying for renders or shooting your own devices, wasting valuable time. I sat down with the app and here’s how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you launch the app for the first time, you’re dropped right into it with no fuss. You’re given an interface that allows you choose from iOS, Mac, and Android devices. By default, all three categories are selected under the “All” tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the top of the window is side-scrolling menu where you can choose the device and layout you desire. This list includes iPads in both horizontal and vertical arrangements, a three-way iPad setup, iPhones in both black and white, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m about bullying testing it out, I took three screenshots of my homepage for the 3-way vertical iPhone arrangement. The middle image aligned properly, but the side two did not, leading to a less-than-ideal visual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-03-15.45.32.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-03-15.45.32.png?resize=882%2C699&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-05-03 15.45.32&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hoping that it was just a bug, I moved to a single device both vertical and laying flat, both iPhones. This time, I had success both times. All hope was not lost on this app. When dragging the image into the zone marked on our mock device, it took next to no time at all for the render to complete. I suspect this is because re-orienting an image within bounds is trivial. I don’t foresee any issues on even lightweight OS X systems like a Macbook Air. My Macbook Pro is four years old and it was just another day in the life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of OS X devices, I wanted to see how well Promotee could churn out mockups of a Macbook Pro. I selected the Mac category and found a mockup of a Macbook Pro (non-retina) just like what I own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we had trouble with the 3-way iPhone setup earlier, I wanted to try again with the 3-way iMac setup. Unlike our iPhone setup earlier, this mockup was flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android devices get some love, too, so don’t worry about that. If you’re looking for additional devices and you bought the App Store version, you can pick up the 5C/iPad mockup and the Macbook Air (perspective) mockup for $0.99 each via an in-app purchase. If you bought the app right from their site, you’ll have to go back to their site to get your mockups, still $0.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve included images below from the app below that I created in the process of writing up this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this app is pretty slick. It does exactly what the developers claim it does, albeit with a hiccup here or there. I suspect whatever bug is plaguing the app will be fixed at some point in the future. For right now, It’s a maybe. It’s $4.99 on both the App Store and straight from their site. It’s possible that by the time you read this, whatever issue I experienced is now fixed. if that’s the case, I’ll update this article accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>18 Resources for Getting Started with WordPress</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/03/18-wordpress-resources/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/03/18-wordpress-resources</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;WordPress is one of the most popular blogging platforms and content management systems on the planet. Created by Matt Mullenweg and the team at Automattic, it’s an open source and free tool using PHP and MySQL for creating just about any kind of site you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going to cover a load of resources for getting yourself familiar with WordPress, what it can do, and how to expand and develop for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics&quot;&gt;Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the technical stuff, we need to cover the basics. You won’t get very far if you don’t know how to install it or navigate its interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The WordPress Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be the single best starting point. Coming straight from the source, every single person new to WordPress needs to read the getting started guid on &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/New_To_WordPress_-_Where_to_Start&quot; title=&quot;The WordPress Codex&quot;&gt;the WordPress Codex&lt;/a&gt;. This guide describes where to start from the very beginning: what a weblog is really all about. It continues from there to making a plan regarding your hosting situation, installation, setting up, working with themes and plugins, and finally getting into some more advanced topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WPBeginner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great beginner guide comes from WPBeginner.com. Like the Codex but more summarized, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-learn-wordpress-for-free-in-a-week-or-less/&quot; title=&quot;WPBeginner WordPress Guide&quot;&gt;guide from WPBeginner&lt;/a&gt; gets you running WordPress “in a week (or less).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a hosted solution, there’s always WordPress.com. With that comes a great guide on getting started there from the folks that make &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt; happen. If you’ve never used WordPress before, &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.wordpress.com/quick-start-guide/&quot; title=&quot;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt; – Get Going Fast” draggable=”false”&amp;gt;this guide might be the single easiest way to get familiar with the software before diving into hosting it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plugins&quot;&gt;Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hongkiat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a good overview on how to make a good quality plugin, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-plugin-development/&quot; title=&quot;Hongkiat&quot;&gt;Hongkiat&lt;/a&gt; has you covered. They cover basic folder structures, naming conventions, best practices, filter, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuts+ – Jeffery Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffery Way has a crash course on plugin development in video format on &lt;a href=&quot;http://Tuts+.com&quot;&gt;Tuts+.com&lt;/a&gt; and covers all the basics to make a good plugin. In this scenario, Way covers how they made an actual plugin to serve a real-world purpose and how he planned it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;themes&quot;&gt;Themes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugin development is only a small part of a sucessful and well-oiled WordPress site. the other portion is a quality theme. Why? Your theme is what peopel see and having it work properly and be as effecient as possible practially goes without saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make&quot;&gt;Make&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress Codex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make your own theme, you can, should you have the proper front-end development skills. The Codex has a rather extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons&quot; title=&quot;Codex&quot;&gt;list of lessons&lt;/a&gt; on various elements of theme developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuts+ – Sam Parkinson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another WordPress pro, Sam Parkinson, has a rather &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch--net-706&quot;&gt;exhaustive tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on creating a WordPress theme from scratch. Parkinson covers the structure of a theme, what the files should look like, and what various functions look like that you’ll likely be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buy&quot;&gt;Buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ok to admit that you’re not good at developing WordPress themes. I’ll admit that, too. Here’s a list of my favorite theme developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecko Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ecko.me&quot;&gt;Their shop&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have a lot in it, yet, but the quality is great and the price points are exactly where they need to be. &lt;strong&gt;ElegantThemes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shop has been around for a while and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elegantthemes.com&quot;&gt;their list of themes is extensive&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of this article, they have 87 themes that come as one large package for $69. That comes out to be around $.80 a theme. if you’re a developer or want lifetime access, you’re looking at still low prices of $89/year or $249 one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;McCallister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s been in it for a while and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://array.is/wordpress-themes/&quot;&gt;collection of themes&lt;/a&gt; serves a wide audience and great support comes with each theme. You can buy each theme individually or get access to the whole collection &lt;a href=&quot;https://array.is/theme-pass/&quot;&gt;for $199&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;free&quot;&gt;Free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also OK to go with a free WordPress theme if you’re finding what you looking for without spending any money. Frankly, WordPress themes can be expensive, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://modernthemes.net&quot;&gt;Modern Themes&lt;/a&gt; is shooting for creating quality themes that don’t cost money. Just because a theme doesn’t have a price tag on it, doesn’t mean it has to be sub-par. Modern Themes hosts a variety of themes that cost zero dollars, with premium options that offer up additional features for a fraction of the price of most premium themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anders Noren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A swedish developer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andersnoren.se&quot;&gt;Anders Noren&lt;/a&gt; creates great WordPress themes, mostly for free. As someone who’s used several of this themes in the past, I can vouch for the quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Theme Directory is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/&quot;&gt;go-to repository&lt;/a&gt; for every &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; approved theme. Each of the themes on this site meet strict quality standards and there are literally thousands to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you’re rocking a hosted WordPress site on WordPress.com, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theme.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; will become a favorite for you. At least 345 themes are featured here of both free and premium varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extra-all-encompassing-video-courses&quot;&gt;Extra: All-Encompassing Video Courses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lynda.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like video training, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lynda.com&quot;&gt;Lynda&lt;/a&gt; has just about anything you could hope for, including WordPress. Prices are great at least than $30 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treehouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/wordpress-development&quot; title=&quot;Treehouse&quot;&gt;track-based development course&lt;/a&gt; that covers the whole gamut of WordPress development, Team Treehouse has a course you’ll be interested in. It covers the basics like going over the Codex, getting a local development environment set up, theming and templating, Bootstrap, customizing the administration panel, and more. It really is an all-in-one course. Treehouse isn’t free, but for $25/month, you can consume as many courses of their as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.tv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/&quot;&gt;free training&lt;/a&gt; and lectures from key players in the WordPress community. If you miss various WordPress events, you might also find them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Udemy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://udemy.com&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; is good for more than programming courses. WordPress developement and administration is on their menu, too, and prices are hard to beat. &lt;strong&gt;WP101&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great video library that you can browse on their site. Created by Shawn Hesketh, a 26-year freelance development guy, he’s made likely a literal ton of WordPress sites for his clients. His tutorials have helped over 100,000 people get into WordPress and build their own sites.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Dad Bod</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/02/the-dad-bod/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/02/the-dad-bod</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://theodysseyonline.com/clemson/dad-bod/97484&quot;&gt;The Dad Bod on The Odyssey Online&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon that at first seemed like a joke but turned out to be completely legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a look that (at least some) women are after called The Dad Bod look. Mackenzie Pearson explains the incredibly fresh term as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dad bod says, “I go to the gym occasionally, but I also drink heavily on the weekends and enjoy eating eight slices of pizza at a time.” It’s not an overweight guy, but it isn’t one with washboard abs, either.After thinking about this for a moment, I came to realize that I probably fit in this category, so I continued reading. It’s unfortunate that this all seems to be sources from the teenage generation, but if anyone is going to make up a new trend, it’ll be those who source their vocabulary from The Urban Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pearson runs off a few items on her list of why a Dad Bod isn’t a bad thing, and what women (I’m sure in a generalized way) like about the “look” that’s nothing more than you enjoy McDonalds but not for three people, daily. I won’t go over them all because that’d spoil the fun of reading the article yourself. The one I enjoyed the most is the last one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Girls tend to picture their future together with their guys early on. Therefore, if he already has the dad bod going on, we can get used to it before we date him, marry him, have three kids. We know what we are getting into when he’s got the same exact body type at the age of 22 that he’s going to have at 45.Gotta play it safe, right? I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about myself, I realize I probably fit in this category. I’m 5’11”, 195lbs. I’m not super skinny but I’m also not of the plumber variety. This probably explains why my wife insists she’s ok with the less-than-chiseled look I have going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the comments was nothing short of amusing, but this one stood out the most:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-15.59.26.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-15.59.26.png?resize=689%2C98&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-05-02 15.59.26&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to lie, I could probably go for a run now and then. I might have gone over the 50% muscle-beer gut line a few steps but one thing’s for sure: I’m surely not going to plan out my bland-as-hell meals for the week and expect me to always be okay with pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/04/30/what_is_the_dad_bod_america_s_leading_expert_explains.html&quot;&gt;Slate interviewed Pearson&lt;/a&gt; on what exactly a Dad Bod is and the responses she’s received from men and women alike.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dart: Java-Free Android Apps</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/02/dart-java-free-android-apps/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/02/dart-java-free-android-apps</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Made by some folks from the Chrome V8 Javascript engine team, Dart tries to solve 20-year old frustrations of working with Java. A language created completely in house, it feels a lot like Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from ArsTechnica:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being fast and responsive is one of the biggest goals for Sky. While 60FPS (or Hz) is the smoothness standard most devices and app developers aim for, the Dart team wants to crank that up to 120FPS, which isn’t even possible to display on the standard 60Hz smartphone screens we have today. That sounds rather improbable on Android, where many apps don’t stay at 60FPS, let alone 120. Rendering an app at 60FPS requires a frame to be drawn every 16ms, and apps “jank” or display an animation stutter, when they can’t keep up with the 16ms deadline.I know the feeling. I’ve experienced it myself many times when I used to own an Android device. I also am a fan of the word “jank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Dart team brought along  &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.domokit.sky.demo&quot;&gt;a demo app&lt;/a&gt;, and it was rendering entire frames in 1.2ms. While it was a simple example, it appears Sky has plenty of headroom for silky-smooth animation on more complicated apps and makes that 120FPS goal (8ms rendering time) seem like a possibility. The Dart team says Sky is “Jank-free by design” with APIs that don’t block the main UI thread, meaning that even if the app slows down, the UI will still be fast and responsive.Now that’s what I’m talking about. I’m not entirely sure why 120fps is necessary as they’re still struggling to get 60fps to run smooth. Baby steps, folks. Sure there’s nothing wrong with aiming high, but I’d hate to see this dropped because they never got to 120fps in real world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Bulk Updating Any Meta Values in WordPress Posts Automatically</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/02/bulk-update-wordpress-meta/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/05/02/bulk-update-wordpress-meta</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I updated the look of my site, today, and with that came a non-standard setup for featured images and the realization I’d have to manually update a lot of posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme requires custom meta be used for the featured image setting to determine how to display an image. As of this post, I have roughly 170 blog posts in the database that would need updating from the beginning of January until now. I definitely didn’t want to spend the next 60 minutes (170 posts * time to click) updating each post, so I did a bit of quick and dirty PHP coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing the code within the_loop() allowed it to run automatically for each post that was presented. Setting the per-page post count to 200, I effectively had all 170 posts pushed on screen at the same time. This subsequently updated all 170 posts at the same time. This of course put a little bit of a hit on my SQL database, but not so much that it bogged it down. I’m sure having 170 * 2 reads then writes all at once blew out a few of the cobwebs. Most of this site is cached pretty effectively so the database doesn’t do much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-18.23.56.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-18.23.56.png?resize=882%2C359&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-05-02 18.23.56&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see in the image above where I made the updates. The first spike should have been the only one, but I entered the wrong value for one of the custom meta fields so I had to go back and do it again. The code has logic so if it was already correct, it skipped it, hence the smaller second peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, the above came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://newrelic.com&quot;&gt;NewRelic&lt;/a&gt;, a service offering made by some pretty cool people. They’re free to use for the basic stuff and their customer service rocks. &amp;lt;/shameless plug&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, without further delay, here’s the code that made this happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/56c68169e85ae18ce62c.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;View the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/56c68169e85ae18ce62c&quot;&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty neat, eh? I know it’s nothing spectacular but it gets the job done, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share this post with everyone you know who’s even just remotely interested in WordPress development. One could even bulk-update posts themselves with zero clicks or interaction necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I did a great thing, today. Time for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Vox Media Open Source Meme Generator</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/30/vox-meme-generator/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-30T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/30/vox-meme-generator</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent some time scouring GitHub this afternoon looking for cool projects. One I stumbled upon was a tool created by Vox Media for creating Twitter cards and Instagram images that included text, source, and site brand logo. I thought it was pretty interesting so I gave it a look-see and started it up in my own space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if it’ll serve me much purpose and I haven’t seen Vox use it much if at all lately. It might have been a one-time use tool, probably around election time. If you’re interested in giving it a whirl, check it out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voxmedia/meme&quot; title=&quot;Meme on Vox Media&#39;s GitHub page&quot;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/a/meme&quot;&gt;running example&lt;/a&gt;, or my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mg.tools.jlyman.net&quot;&gt;running example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’m not sure they totally get is that these image aren’t quite memes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com&quot;&gt;These&lt;/a&gt; are memes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Sad, Lonely World of Yik Yak</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/30/the-sad-lonely-world-of-yik-yak/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-30T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/30/the-sad-lonely-world-of-yik-yak</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/O825ko-BK0k?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I downloaded what some are calling the winner of the Secret-Whisper-YikYak battle for anonymous sharing. YikYak works like Whisper and Secret, except there’s one thing very different about it, at least from what I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending just ten minutes on the app, a trend started appearing. Actually, several trends. If you struggle with any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Periods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ADHD Drugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General Sadness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High School&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High School Drinking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General High School Sadness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Awkward First-Time Sex&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Awkward Butt Stuff
Then Yik Yak is for you. Ask your doctor about high-strength Yik Yak that involes constantly commenting on stranger’s life struggles with your own quips that likely have a nominal effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed with Secret is that people seemed to as least be older than 15. I never tried Whisper so who knows what whack stuff went on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to YikYak…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy. I think…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>For-Profit Colleges</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/30/for-profit-colleges/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-30T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/30/for-profit-colleges</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not really surprising that Corinthian Colleges shut its doors. It’s also not surprising that there are students out there who are angry the schools are closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see two things come from this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone with pitchforks who hate for-profit colleges want to see them all burn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too many students are upset because they’re now without a completed degree, but don’t understand their degree probably wouldn’t land them a job in the first place.
When it comes to for-profit education, it’s easy to lump all schools together. However they’re not all alike. In the case of Corinthian Colleges, their “campuses” were really just large commercial/retail spaces that taught very specialized material. Everest College was strictly medial, and WyoTech was strickly mechanical. These schools did not provide general post-secondary education in high-demand fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can typically tell what the overall end-goal of a for-profit college is by what it offers students. In Corinthian’s case, they jumped on the bandwagon carrying people who sat at home watching day-time TV and collected unemployment checks. I know, I used to be in that position. That was the only time of the day they advertised, likely for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s cheap to advertise mid-weekday in a market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best suckers are the ones who feel most vulnerable and use Jerry Springer episodes to feel better.
The second reason is likely a stretch and generalization, but there’s also a reason Jerry is only on mid-weekday in most markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people protrayed in the ads are those who Corinthian likely hoped would see them: single men and women of all colors who probably had families to feed and insane amounts of debt. They just want to do something good with their life, so why not medial billing or fixing something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds great, but neither are careers unless you plan on working for a large facility at some point in your life. In order to even be looked at, though, you’ll have to have a full degree from somewhere accredited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems start seeping through the cracks right about now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers cared very little about Corinthian school educations. If two people applied for one job and had all the same qualifications but one got their education at Everest, you know which one the employer will pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This became a real problem for a lot of students because the faux job placement assistance ended up being garbage. I’m sure there are a few out there who got jobs, but I doubt they got &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; jobs. A good comparison is the IT world. There’s a big difference between fixing computers at Best Buy’s Geek Squad for a career, making $12/hour and working on one of Google’s many systems engineering teams, likely making $75/hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to say that not all for-profit schools are a waste of time. Quality comes down to what they offer, like I said before. That sounds counter-intuitive, but let me give a great example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argosy University. It’s parent company has had their name thrown around before related to other schools in their organization being less than ideal. Argosy University as a school, however, offers actual accredited degrees, however. Some facilities go as high as Ph.D. and Psy.D. level education with industry accrediation. Everest wouldn’t have ever reached that goal with the quality of education they provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m sure Argosy’s parent company has had their fair share of exposure for “meh” educational offerings, in post-secondary education, it’s not always appropriate to throw the baby out with the bath water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I wrap up, I want to make it perfectly clear that I used Everest/WyoTech and Argosy as examples because those are examples I am familiar enough with to use as comparisons. I wouldn’t promote or sponsor any of the schools or companies mentioned in this post even if I was paid to, because that’s not right and that’s not what I do on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also make sure to point out that Education Management Corp, the company that owns Argosy University, hasn’t been without its faults, but the level of investigation and potentially shady behavior has been limited to specific schools in specific areas, not the organization as whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with that out of the way, keep an open mind, but don’t be stupid. If it sounds like its too good to be true, it probably is. In the case of Corinthian Colleges, everything they &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; they did was too good to be true and what they actually provided couldn’t have been farther from what was advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Like That Zappos Guy</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/26/like-that-zappos-guy/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/26/like-that-zappos-guy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago I talked about killing in people relations, a.k.a kicking ass at customer service. I suggested a book by Dale Carnegie called How to Win Friends and Influence People. I also said there was a second book I recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That second book is by the CEO of Zappos, the site that sells a ton of shoes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JTHXN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003JTHXN6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=F2YCPEVVP25QDMQI&quot;&gt;Delivering Happiness&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just about learning how to smooth-talk through the phone or how to close a sale. It’s about making people feel appreciated. The book outlines what Tony Hsieh (pronounced shay) did and still does to make Zappos as awesome as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay brand-new employees $2000 to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make customer service the responsibility of the entire company-not just a department&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on company culture as the #1 priority&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply research from the science of happiness to running a business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help employees grow-both personally and professionally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seek to change the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make money.
I took that list from Amazon’s description. They also feature a Q&amp;amp;A with Hsieh that’s quite enlightening and definitely worth &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JTHXN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003JTHXN6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=F2YCPEVVP25QDMQI&quot;&gt;checking out&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an Kindle or a tablet, I suggest buying it that way as it’s cheaper than the Hardcover and Paperback, and it takes less space. If you’re like me and feel like taking a nap when you read, get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QADCNS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003QADCNS&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=NTRBAV6C7SGGCZEJ&quot;&gt;Audible version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read it already, let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Killing It In People Relations</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/23/killing-it-in-people-relations/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/23/killing-it-in-people-relations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My latest challenge in my career is executing the position of Senior Technical Support Lead for the Americas at &lt;a href=&quot;http://getzephyr.com/&quot;&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;, the software company that is, I believe, up-ending the software test management space. My primary responsibility is making technical support as awesome as possible for our Americas customers. This got me thinking on what resources I could use to my advantage in bettering the experiences our customers have when they call in or open a case at &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.getzephyr.com&quot;&gt;support.getzephyr.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is my technical support team needs to be challenged. Not just technically, but challenged within themselves. Each individual needs to be challenged to better themselves including their confidence levels, relationship skills, communication, and being able to think on their feet when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a long list of things to work on though and becoming overloaded is the last thing I want to happen which is why I want to use this post to focus on one’s self. There are two really good books that anybody who’s speaking with people on a regular basis should read, one of which I’ll cover today, and the next I’ll cover in my next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEAI4E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003WEAI4E&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=2EUNCBNEPDTZAPLF&quot;&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, Carnegie’s dead. Yes, the book was written in the old days. Yes, it’s still relevant. What he said in 1936 still holds weight today, because at no point in history was it suddenly OK to be happy with mediocrity. No one said that taking a bland lifestyle should be the norm. We used to call the American Dream the American Dream for a reason. If you dream of middle-of-the-road-ness, then go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d bet money though, that you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Amazon said in their formal review of the book (emphasis my own):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and &lt;strong&gt;85 percent&lt;/strong&gt; to “the ability to &lt;strong&gt;express ideas&lt;/strong&gt; , to assume &lt;strong&gt;leadership&lt;/strong&gt; , and to &lt;strong&gt;arouse enthusiasm&lt;/strong&gt; among people.” He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for &lt;strong&gt;handling people&lt;/strong&gt; without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person’s point of view and “arousing in the other person an eager want.”That’s exactly what every individual in a human-facing position should be able to do. There’s a line between being fake and manipulative and being powerful in your position. I don’t think this book covers that and it shouldn’t. Where that line is drawn is wholly up to you, but whoever it is, stand on the good side. As a good friend of mine once told me, “you have to put a leash on it and own it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only do one thing today make it this: buy this book. Read the hell out of it. Read it again. I want you to consume this knowledge as I will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Norway&#8217;s Radio</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/21/norways-radio/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/21/norways-radio</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a bit of confusion surrounding Norway’s announcement they’ll stop broadcasting FM radio. Someone didn’t do their homework when they started writing titles for the various articles that are covering the matter, so I hope I can spend a few minutes and clarify the topic for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the original source. An article by &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.no/2015/04/norway-to-switch-off-fm-in-2017/&quot;&gt;Radio.no&lt;/a&gt; uses the following title in their article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Norway to Switch Off FM in 2017That sounds pretty ominous like there’s an end to radio broadcasting as we know it, or something. Other news outlets are twisting it into being Norway killing radio altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too bad that’s not the whole story. The article goes on to talk about how “the Ministry of Culture announced a national FM-switch off, to complete the transition to digital radio.” Wait, so we’re not killing off FM radio? They just said FM is going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FM as we know it (the analog broadcasting medium that requires a lot of radio bandwidth and provides little result) is going away… eventually. In Norway, it’ll start on January 11th, 2017 and will start with national broadcasters like NRK, P4, and SBS. The end of this transition is slated for December 13th of the same year, almost a full 12 months. So really, analog FM radio is dead in Norway on December 13, 2017, not January 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What won’t cease to exist is radio broadcasting. Norway is dropping analog FM for an open standard called DAB or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting#Single-frequency_networks&quot;&gt;Digital Audio Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt;. It also goes by the name Eureka-147 in the standards world because it was created as a research project in the late 90s for the European Union by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(organization)&quot;&gt;Eureka&lt;/a&gt;, a pan-European research and development organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Audio Broadcasting is like the United States’ HDRadio, except the US version is proprietary and owned by a corporation (not surprising, really). According to what I’ve read about DAB and the specs therein, it’s essentially over-the-air broadcasting of MP2 or AAC-encoded audio and is broadcasted as a part of a package of streams within a chunk of radio frequency. Each broadcast allows for 1000kbps of bandwidth per “channel” whereas HDRadio only allows 300kbps and is based on a main broadcast with digital simulcasts immediately above and below on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Audio Broadcasting will never likely catch on in America since the Federal Communications Commission chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdradio.com&quot;&gt;HD Radio&lt;/a&gt; is the go-to standard nor will analog radio broadcasts ever &lt;a href=&quot;http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-02-286A1.pdf&quot;&gt;likely be eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the states, which I’m sure broadcasters here both enjoy and hate at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analog terrestrial radio takes an immense amount of power to do successfully and the amount of interference from neighboring towers and stations gets higher as you increase said power. Analog radio bleeds a lot into neighboring frequencies unlike digital so the amount of stations possible in the FM band is limited more so in comparison to all digital broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norway has the right idea. Sure they won’t be using the FM frequencies, anymore, but what does that matter? FM is too low to support any meaningful data transfer and the frequency bands for DAB (Band III in particular) are high enough to stay out of the way of FM (should it become a free zone like CB and Wifi) but low enough to avoid other arbitrary bands used for other purposes. In America, though, Band III covers half of the old analog TV spectrum (174-216mhz plus a few mobile and fixed radio uses). Combining that with the FCC going with HD Radio, DAB is dead in the American water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t forsee anything to worry about. Typically people that freak out about stuff like this don’t really realize they might already be in a digital broadcasting area and just don’t know it. Analog’s death as a broadcasting medium should have happened a decade ago. It’s expensive and power-hungry and offers very little in terms of feature.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ten Days a Californian</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/16/10-days/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/16/10-days</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If my calendar is correct, ten days of living in California is today. As someone who’s lived in one state their whole life, nay, one metro area in one state, it’s been a huge change. The world around me is fresh and exciting, but equally craptacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, I’m not leaving. Maybe that’s also the bad news, who knows. We’re here for the long haul and I’ve discussed and mentally prepared for it &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/scared-to-act&quot;&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/be-ready&quot;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/couch-chapter&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/wasted&quot;&gt;advance&lt;/a&gt;. I even highlighted my trip by day in summary (day &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/dust-settling&quot;&gt;reflected&lt;/a&gt; briefly after all the dust settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll just come right out and say it: this place is dry. Not dry like “my clothes are dry, this dryer rocks!” More like: “my clothes turn to dust! This dryer rocks!” The humidity was 14% today. That might not seem like much but to compare, think desert. No, not dessert. One “s,” like the sounds snakes make… in the desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See exhibit A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/361745-5.jpeg?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That about sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not all bad, though. Moving from a state that gets eight feet of rain a year to a state that gets sloppy seconds from Mother Nature has perks. It’s sunny, a lot! This time of year, we were lucky to see the sun. It rained. Of course now that I’ve moved away, Washington’s getting a sexy session with the sun and there’s a lot of sun to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also tan. It took exactly one day to become tan. Us northern people tan easy. Too bad it doesn’t make traffic any less of a suck-fest and California drivers any more skilled at using their turn signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could rant for a solid hour on California drivers, but I don’t think that’s necessary. This guy has a pretty good summary on video, so consume this 18 minutes of sad-but-true. Half of this I see on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMR_BVpMvl8?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel I’ve given California enough credit. The ocean is damn awesome and I love being so close to it. Without traffic, it’s 45 minutes. That’s spectacular. In Washington, it was a four hour romp (each way) that included an hour (each way) and $50 (round trip) on a ferry. Given the scale of the Bay Area, everything’s so close, too. Public transit (train-based) is legit and quick to move around. The bus system blows harder than &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina&quot;&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, though. Who needs to have a 45 minute layover half-way through a 10 mile journey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this guy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boring.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boring.gif?resize=500%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;boring&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>California Move Day 4 &#8211; It&#8217;ll Fit, Watch!</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was the day we were all waiting for. The day we drive into town, unload the truck, and start our lives in California. This was also the day I forgot how much I don’t like moving up and down stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I pulled in, I barely fit. The power steering was whining because I insisted on holding the wheel all the way to the right. The truck fit, and the trailer followed behind, by only by a hair. Mere inches were between my front bumper and the gate edge, and same with my trailer wheels. Someone didn’t think the entrance through enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I found a place to park the truck and get rid of the trailer so we could unload. It was warm, but not super hot… 60-something, if I remember correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took a few hours to unload the truck when we counted breaks. Having help was nice, especially when it came to conquering the three flights of stairs. Before dinner, we were done and the truck was back where it belonged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So glad it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>California Move Day 3 &#8211; Coming &#8216;Round the Mountain</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/12/move-day-3/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Siskiyous mountains are rough for a moving truck. At times we hummed along at 55 to 60 mph and when we hit big climbs, we sputtered at 35 to 40. It’s rough going for a gas-powered truck-trailer. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, please let me fill you in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas-powered trucks have zero oomph when pulling a load. None. Their torque is present at a much higher rev range than diesel and unfortunately, those higher revs also sit close to the engine’s limit. I wanted to give the truck 100% throttle to power up the hills, but if I did, I felt it would explode. See, to make our journey up a 7% grade even at 40 mph, the engine needed to run at 4000-4250 RPM. For scale, the gauge stops at 6000 and the truck shifts well before then. I was at my limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with such slow and gas-guzzling climbs, we managed to stay on target for fuel usage and didn’t lose too much time. The most embarrassing part: loaded semi trucks passing you. Damn you, Budget Truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we got out of the mountains, we made a quick pit stop in Redding, CA to top off and sprinted to Sacramento, where we met friends for our last night on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>California Move Day 2 &#8211; To Medford</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/12/move-day-2/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/12/move-day-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now the real fun begins. There’s nothing more that I’ve wanted from life than to drive a 40’ truck-trailer combination over 900 miles. Today’s journey took us to Medford, OR, where we make our first of two on-the-road stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose to stay in the Ramada, and it’d been so long since I stayed in a place like that I forgot what it was like. Apparently, they opted to not redecorate since I last stayed in one in the 90s. The hotel was crap. I’m not sure it was worth the $64 a night price tag, but at least the WiFi was good. It was great actually. Probably because nobody was actually staying there besides truckers. The bed was hard and the breakfast was meh, but it did its job as a place to sleep for the night. Medford is a surprisingly beautiful area. The south Oregon mountains are awesome and quite a site to see, compared to the rest of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much happened on the journey south. We sat in the truck for nine hours including stops, filled up once with what seemed like an entire tanker of gas, and somehow managed 12mpg, with car trailer. I was quite impressed, but at the same time, not. Budget really needs to stop using gas engines in their tow-capable trucks. We could have skipped a stop if we were rolling in a diesel truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experienced a Popeye’s for the second time in my life. The first time involved me wishing I hadn’t experienced Popeye’s. This time, it was actually decent, but considering this was the fourth or fifth meal involving fast food, I was starting to feel pretty gross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bane of my existence has yet to come, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>California Move Day 1 – Deposits My Ass</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/12/move-day-1/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/12/move-day-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s the day. We packed up all our stuff over the last couple of weeks and picked up our moving truck this morning. We loaded it all in a relatively short amount of time (we do only have an apartment, after all). So far, the trip’s been alright, as we haven’t left town, yet, and won’t until tomorrow morning. Funny story, though…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were up at 6:30 getting ready to start the long day. I’m dreading the level of effort that’s about to be bestowed upon me by the laws of gravity and physics. By 7:30 we had breakfast. Thanks Jack in the Box!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 8:00am, we were at the rental truck facility. By virtue of being the lowest price for our one-way trip, we graced Budget Truck with our presence. The place looked kinda sketchy and rightly so: it was nothing more than a double-wide. For a place that also offered rental cars via Avis, it was hard to tell what cars were actually available to rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 8:30 we had the truck back home and ready to accept our crap. Most of our stuff was already boxed up so it came down to making trips two and from the truck with the dolly. This part only took a couple hours. Most of our furniture was boxed up (we ordered some new stuff, because why not!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come 10:30 and we’re back at Budget Truck ready for our car trailer. We’re taking a 22-foot truck (16 feet cargo space plus six feet for the chassis, give or take) and adding another 16.5-foot trailer on the back. I love the plan. This $45 trailer will net us $150 in gas savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention we have a cat? No? Well… we have a cat, and this is where it starts getting interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now 12:00 and we’re at our hotel, the Holiday In Express &amp;amp; Suites. I’ve stayed there before and they were pretty nice for a 3-star hotel. I expected more nice-but-not-worthy-of-instagramming experiences. We checked in, and informed them of our cat, because I want to make sure the reservation at a pet-friendly hotel was still legitimate. Turns out it was, they are pet friendly. As it also turns out, they charge $50 per three nights as an added fee, like paying for a room for your pet. Oh… but according to Hanna, the wonderfully nice woman at the reception desk explained the moment she, herself discovered for the first time it seemed, they don’t take cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in a bit of a subdued panic because our whole schedule is pretty well locked down. We already turned in our apartment keys and for all intents and purposes, we’re transients. I’ll be honest, I paid $90 for my room through Hotwire. I thought it was a good deal. That’s about the price I paid the last time I stayed at HIES via Hotwire, roughly two to three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give Hotwire a call, crossing my fingers they’ll refund my non-refundable purchase. Turns out they will, only if the room and or reservation isn’t as advertised. I had the right in two areas: 1) they were only &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; pet friendly, something Hotwire didn’t advertise properly, and 2) the rate on Hotwire’s site should have been the only amount I had to pay, which it wasn’t. After roughly five minutes, it was all squared away and I had my money back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now what? I’m without a hotel room. In comes my trusty hotel sidekick to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a single hotel chain that’s always come through for my family and my wife’s family alike, the La Quinta. It’s roughly on the same level as HIES, and about the same price. I gave them a rang because I know their properties and know what kind of rooms they offer up. An ever so friendly gentleman named Kurtis (I checked, he spells it that way) helped us out. They had a room open tonight and they were pet friendly. They also don’t charge a fee, because that’s weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m a AAA member, they took 10% off and we were in business for $100. Sure it was $10 more, but I’d rather pay that difference than $50. It was within reason. Within 20 minutes we had our room and were moving in for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 1:00pm and nap time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 3:30, my wife found it prudent to give our other hotel reservations a call and find out if they charge a separate pet fee. Turns out they both did. The Ramada in Medford, OR charges $20, and the Double Tree in Newark, CA charges $50. The $20 is okay, the $50 is not. I called Hotwire again, and complained once more. I fed them a story about false advertising and whatnot, and within a few minutes I had my money back, again. It would be great if Hotwire advertised extra fees like this before you buy your supposedly non-refundable stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed our stay at the La Quinta. While it’s nothing special to look at they’re good at making breakfast and having comfy beds. They could step up their WiFi game a bit. The particular hotel I stayed at had misconfigured WiFi. All of their hotspots were on the same channel. If you’re not technically inclined enough to know what that means, let me use this analogy: imagine six people talking to you at the same time, at the same volume, saying the same thing. Which one are you going to pay attention to? With all of the hotel’s hotspots on the same frequency, doing the same thing, the airwaves become a garbled mess, and my laptop had a hard time staying connected. Noob move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, our first day was uneventful. We packed up and rested. The real fun begins on day two.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a couple weeks since I posted anything substantial, for good reason. Today is one of the first days I’ve had since the beginning of the month to sit down and write, now that the dust is settling. Moving is a big deal and is nothing short of a lot of work. Over the next few days, I’ll be sharing some of my adventures and experiences. After that, I’ll talk about what it’s like for a northwesterner in California, a state that’s had minimal rain since I arrived. I’ll give you a sneak peak: I’m already tan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chuckled at this one, because the struggle is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it got me to thinking. What are some of the small things in life that are actually quite enjoyable and satisfying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think for me, one of the most satisfying small things is when I sit down to write, I have this sudden flow of words, as if they came out of nowhere. I don’t have to look at my list of things I want to talk about, I don’t have to browse the Internet looking for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just happens.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;end game (n.) – the late or final stages of any activity.Thinking about what my goal for this blog is made me realize: I don’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m ok with that. There’s something to be said about just wanting to do something because you can. I don’t play video games because at one point I’ll end up being a professional gamer and spending my life playing League of Legends for money. I don’t blog because one day I want to make this site a full time job earning money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least not right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s always the same thought that crosses my mind every once in a while regarding the slim possibility this site ever becomes famous or even just a smidgen popular. I have plans for my blog but none of them involve some masterful end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time progresses, things change. When traffic increases, perhaps it’ll be time to focus on specific topics or themes. Right now, I ramble most of the time and post generic stuff. Sometimes there’s a theme, sometimes not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know people read this but I also know more people would read it if they found it interesting to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now though,t it doesn’t really matter. I write because I can, because I want to. I write because it frankly feels good to me. Some people knit, some paint. Writing makes me feel like I accomplished something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as I can continue to do just that, I don’t need an end goal. And end is an exit. I don’t want to exit from writing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stress</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/25/stress</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Acid Reflux sucks. I don’t typically suffer from such things but lately it’s been rough. Part of this big (to me) move is having to leave a place I grew up and essentially spent all of my living years behind. Compound that with everything that’s going into moving and the amount of money it really does cost to move. Don’t think you can move for cheap… that’s just not a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s been quite interesting, however, is the closer I get to the magic date, the better I feel. When everything first became a reality, I was stupid scared. I didn’t sleep well if at all, I constantly missed my alarm, wasn’t productive throughout the day, etc. It sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time has passed and I’m getting closer to April 4th, I’m starting to be okay with the idea. I’ve moved my Comcast service, I’ve set up utilities, paid some deposits, looked into things to do in the area, how the city works, etc. I’ve also allotted myself a few days before I start working at my new job to relax and enjoy the area. I know one of the first things I want to do the morning after we move in is sit on my deck and watch the sun rise. Hell yeah that sounds nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Washington, I wouldn’t have the slightest opportunity to do that: we have too many tall trees and my deck faces south surrounded by those damn tall trees. In Cali, I’ll have an uninterrupted view of the east with just gentle rolling hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s thing like that that make me okay with the whole thing. I look at the weather and see it’s going to be sunny and not sad like it is in Washington. I see it’ll be warmer all around so I don’t have to wear layers to combat 37 degrees and wind and then try to pack them home in the afternoon with 55 and all sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just writing about all this is making me feel less stressed out. Reflecting on all the new and cool that I’ll get to experience is making things easier on me. I’ve moved past the grieving stage and have accepted my departure as fact. The last hurdle I’ll have to jump is two days of driving. If we were driving in a car and not a moving truck, we could do it in one day (12.5 hours non-stop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the effects of stress still leave an effect on me every once in a while, it’s not as bad as it could be, I’m getting tired of chewing Alka Seltzer Heartburn Chewables. They taste flavorful until they ever so smoothly remind you that they’re chalky and full of hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

I also like learning, so I got the best of both worlds when I took the time a few days ago to set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://redis.io&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; as a front-end cache for WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing it was dead simple. I already had the PHP &lt;a href=&quot;http://pecl.php.net/package/redis&quot;&gt;PECL module&lt;/a&gt; installed, so all I needed to do was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis&quot;&gt;install it via apt-get&lt;/a&gt;, install a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/&quot;&gt;WordPress plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m on my way. It took less than ten minutes. Way cool.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why This Site</title>

   <updated>2015-03-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/23/why-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve kept this site going with mostly daily content for the last few months now, and I’m quite impressed with how far it’s come. It’s no money maker, for sure. It likely never will be. At some point, this address won’t even point to a blog, but a more professional presentation of me. This blog will be delegated to its own address with its own name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s a project for another time. Right now, I want to reflect on why I do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t blog because all the cool kids are doing it. I don’t blog because it’s my job. I don’t blog because I have something I want the entire world to hear or read. I blog because I can. Plain and simple. I do it because have thoughts and things I want to talk about to whomever will listen and this is the best way to do that without annoying the hell out of someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blog because it’s the right thing to do. I could keep all my thoughts and words to myself, but what’s the fun in that? What’s the point? The truth of the matter is, you’re not protecting yourself from anyone by doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don’t care if my thoughts don’t elicit the proper responses. I’m telling a story, explaining something, or just flat out offering my opinion. Whether people like it or not is up to them and at the end of the day, all I’m doing is blogging… because I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up this site originally as a portal for just that. After having jlyman.net for a couple years and not really doing anything with it, I decided it would make for a good home for this project. Coincidentally, having this site has also kept my mind fresh regarding self-hosting a site and all that goes into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’d have the same attachment to it if I used a managed service. I think that gives me an advantage regarding staying the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That and I have lots to say.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m always looking for new ways to learn how to code. Up until recently, I had no idea where to really start with Swift, the language used to craft iOS apps and games that mades its appearance in iOS 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I came across Swifty, a free app (with a couple in-app purchases) that teaches you the basics of iOS programming. I recommend you go check it out on the App Store. It’s a great way to get started and with no cost for entry, if you don’t like it, you’re not out any money. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swifty-learn-to-code-in-swift!/id886315617?mt=8&quot;&gt;available for both the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Couch&#8217;s Next Chapter</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/22/couch-chapter/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/22/couch-chapter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two weeks from the day I write this, we’ll be on the road headed south. If I have my way, we’ll be at our half-way point and relaxing into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that’s two weeks from now. In present day, I’m sitting here with a mostly empty home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we decided to do was sell most of our furniture to a) make room for new stuff, b) get better fuel economy, and c) make a few extra bucks by giving furniture to people who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been harder than I thought in terms of parting with items that have essentially been with us since the beginning. We sold what really was our first couch, a couch donated to us by my wife’s parents. It wasn’t anything special, but it helped us out immensely and it became a staple in our living room for the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, and we sold it last week on Craigslist for a very small fee. I don’t know what it was off the top of my head but I feel like it was somewhere around $50. That’s not a lot, and we weren’t expecting to sell it for a lot, because it’s a simple couch and wasn’t new by any means. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s important to tell about this story isn’t that we sold a couch for chump change compared to a new one, it’s to whom it was sold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buyers of our starter couch were a young couple, like us. They were moving to a new home and didn’t have any furniture to start. For this story, I’m assuming it’s their first solo space together, given their age. They looked like they were in their early 20s, maybe 22. While I’m only a few years older, I can remember what it felt like just a few years ago to try to scrape together enough to buy furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wonderful young couple also nabbed a couple night stands from us, too, for their new space. We helped them load the furniture and sent them on their way. I’m sure they’ll be able to put the couch to good use, just like we did. If they only have it for a year, it’ll have served its purpose. Perhaps they’ll sell it to someone else who will be in need, too, and it can continue on its journey providing butt comfort for new home owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only story I have about people who’ve come and obtained furniture from us. A lady came by today to pick up our coffee table. Her and her partner are moving into a larger space from a tiny Seattle urban apartment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another person bought our bed frame and dresser from us. He was recovering from breaking up with his girlfriend of a long time (I want to say seven years). She wanted to get married, and he wasn’t ready for such commitments. (Yes, I know seven years is a long time to be with someone and what’s marriage at that point, right? I don’t know what to tell you, here. I wasn’t there to ask the guy questions)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I write this, there’s only two pieces left: the entertainment center that houses my networking gear, the Playstation 4, and the TV as well as the desk at which I sit to write this post. It’ll be hardest for me to get rid of this desk because I enjoy my daily ritual of writing. It’s what I usually do in the morning to keep stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know things are going to be a bit crazy for a few weeks and I’ve already come to terms with the idea that I won’t be writing as much. I guess I could still sit at our dining room table. That’s the one piece of hard furniture that isn’t from IKEA and solid wood. We just bought it and I like it. I’m putting my foot down there. Sure I could put my foot down at my desk, but I could go for a simpler space, too. I don’t need drawers. Just a flat surface to put my laptop down on, maybe room for a notepad to write on, and my basic pull-cord lamp, powered by the one LED lightbulb we own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s honestly been rough coming to the realization that we’re moving soon. I’ve lived her my whole life and in two weeks we start fresh somewhere totally new for both of us. What’s made it easier to swallow is seeing our stuff go to good homes where people need it. Our dump run will be minimal and we already made a Goodwill run, today, where other stuff of ours will find a home and be used by someone, somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing about life is that things always change and change can be scary but it can also be good.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hands on with GAget</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/21/hands-on-with-gaget/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/21/hands-on-with-gaget</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/gaget&quot;&gt;couple blurbs&lt;/a&gt; about an iOS app and OS X notification widget called &lt;a href=&quot;http://gagetapp.com/&quot;&gt;GAget&lt;/a&gt;. I received the opportunity to get some hands-on time with it and now I’m ready to share with you my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ios-app&quot;&gt;iOS App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let’s start with the iOS version, simply because I have my phone in front of me. When I first wrote about GAget, I had an iPhone 5. Now I have an iPhone 6. The app isn’t optimized for the iPhone 6 and 6+ but no matter as it still looks pretty dang good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the app is dead simple. You’re asked to go in to a Google account (ideally one that has access to Google Analytics) to get started. You’re taken to a Google sign in page where you’re instructed to enter your credentials. If you have two-step authentication enabled on your account like I do, you’ll have to take care of that, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon verifying your credentials and accepting the app’s request to view your &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; data, you’re taken to a wonderful home screen.  All the essentials you need to keep track of visitor history is right there. This app isn’t for those who want to have super granular campaign data or do whatever they do with behavior tracking. That’s not what this app is about. GAget is for those who want the basics and they want it without fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re presented with a line graph of historical data regarding visitors, and are shown the most recent entry, which should be the same day. As you scroll down, you get to see things like overall stats for the last two weeks including visits, unique visitors, and total page views among said visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is you’re given some nice circle-based metrics (a.k.a. a pie chart) showing more visit and exit percentages. Follow that up with some averages and a detailed traffic breakdown and you’re on your way! Need a refresh? just shake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is lightweight, super smooth, and supposedly comes with the ability to use your site as a background. I was unable to get this to work, however, but I imagine it looks good, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GAget will allow you to view multiple sites, if you have more than one present in Google Analytics. All you need to do is swipe left and right to move through them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;os-x-widget&quot;&gt;OS X Widget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widget that sits in the OS X notification center functions a lot like the iOS app in that it shows you a lot of the same information, only if you request it. The widget sits in the Today section and by default only shows you your visits for the day, but when clicked, expands to show recent history, as well. It doesn’t have the same granularity in terms of sources of traffic but everything else seems to be present. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widget is really meant for a quick glance at the action taking place on your site and how many millions of people you have coming to see your wares. It’s ok if you don’t have millions. It don’t, and it works for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget/id716442061&quot;&gt;iOS app&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget-simple-widget-for-google/id968487158?mt=12&quot;&gt;OS X widget&lt;/a&gt; are priced well, at $1.99 and $2.99 each. The iOS doesn’t have a free option nor does it have any kind of ads present, so it’s really one of those pay-once-enjoy-forever deals that I personally really like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a week with both versions  and I like each in its own way. They make glancing at your data easy and painless and for the price, you really can’t go wrong with that much more convenience. For the price of a cup of coffee, you can have both apps. For the price of a vending machine snack, you can have your Google Analytics data in your phone without the fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I received an email from the App developer and clarified a couple points in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>iPhone Trade In</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/20/iphone/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/20/iphone</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did something I never thought I’d have to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traded in my iPhone 5 and signed up for Verizon EDGE and got an iPhone 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means: I’m making payments on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might not sound bad to some, and I totally get the idea behind it. It serves a purpose, and I think I discovered one of those purposes. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until yesterday, I had a white iPhone 5. It served its purpose. It didn’t have the largest capacity nor was it perfect on the outside. It worked and it worked well… most of the time. On occasion, it would play battery tricks on me that I didn’t appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: I’m using my phone and going about my business when I look at my battery level to see it’s at 50%. No big deal, that’ll last me a few hours at my current pace. A couple minutes later, I look at my screen and am informed I am at 10%. That’s odd, I was at 50% just a few minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, I’m &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; at 4%. Depending on the scenario, my butt might be puckering a bit at this point. As I find a charger and plug it in, my phone tells me I have 50% remaining once more. Unplugging my phone in confusion, my battery stays at 50%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I just experience? Am I in the twilight zone or is the phone hardware just not doing its job reporting remaining charge anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely the second. In cases where my charge drops dramatically, it will stay there until the likely real charge passes that level, in which case it resumes recording depletion. I had it run on 7% for two hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t handle that drama, anymore. I called Verizon and asked them what it would take to buy out the rest of my contract so I could re-sign and get a new phone. Turns out, it would take a cancellation of my line. Well… that blows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh but wait! Haley, the customer service person on the other end says I’m eligible for a “promotion” that involves signing up for Verizon EDGE so long as I turn in my old phone. Hmm. I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about making monthly payments on a phone, paying full price for it in the end, and still being in a contract, but I didn’t care at the time, and $31 a month isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a nutshell, I caved and signed up for what I never thought I would do. On the plus side, I have a sexy new phone that really does kick a lot of ass. On the neutral side, my next bill will be  $140 larger than normal (they bill you for sales tax).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeeee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: The cat photo has nothing to do with anything I just wrote. I like cats.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/18/moving-to-cali</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s official. We’re headed to California. What that means for my blog is that there might not be a lot of content for the next few weeks. I’m going to try and schedule posts as best I can. I would have something written today but I believe I pulled something in my back last night moving our couch so today was slow going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Commuting and Wasted Time</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/17/wasted/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/17/wasted</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I commute a rather long ways (measured by time, not distance) to work every morning. By way of bus it’s 80 minutes. By way of car, it’s 45. The distance is only 20 miles. To some, that’s a lot. I know people that have never commuted more than 20 minutes in any one direction in their life. I envy them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I envy them because long commutes steal life from creativity, drain the energy from what makes us get up in the morning and want to do what we do, give us motivation to continue long term, and make us wish ever more that the weekend would just hurry up and get here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s likely changing after our move to the Bay Area in a couple months is commuting. We only have one car, and that works for us. After we land, we plan on keeping it that way. Fortunately, we’ve found an area that will allow us to keep the cheap public transit option in play and the need for a second car at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except this time it’ll be the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken the bus to work for the last three years. Before that, I used to drive into work. I had to be at work at 5AM, so there weren’t many busses that ran from where I was coming from that early. After a shift in location, the bus became an option and we rolled with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As each year passed, taking the bus to and from work became gradually easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again this year, it will become easier, still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a point to all this that I’m trying to make. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t name one person who wouldn’t want a shorter commute. We strive for those extra minutes of sleep. We strive for those extra minutes of being home with our families before sleep. See how odd that is? In the morning, we want nothing more than to sleep in. In the evening, we want nothing more than to be awake to do stuff or e with our families and friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is there so much prejudice toward the morning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody’s a morning person, whether they want to admit it or not. I used to believe I wasn’t a morning person, then I started waking up between 4-4:30 am not to go to work, but to write. I started doing something I found interesting and stimulating, and now I do it every week day. The weekends aren’t quite the same, but I’m still up before most people my age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to laugh at the idea of being a morning person. Around that same time, I used to get up at noon, too. I always had an inkling in the back of my mind that I really wanted to be up before the sun and be productive before the Today Show started on the east coast, but I didn’t really understood what that took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I think I do. I’m not a master of that, yet, as there are still days—like this one—where I falter a bit. With those trick days, it’s important to still try and stick to the routine as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of days, I’ve been a bit behind in the mornings and end up doing my writing on the first of two legs of my morning bus journey. Since I usually have ideas already ready to go, putting the words down isn’t very difficult and can be done with little effort. The problem I’m facing now is that I’m getting used to that idea, and that’s not what I want, at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started this blog in January, the goal was first to just write a few days a week, then it was to create something every day. Both iterations of that goal involved a routine. I talked briefly about hacking my sleep routine—or whatever the startup kids say these days—to make it more qualitatively productive instead of quantitative. That’s been the hardest part throughout all this. As much as I try, I can’t always get to bed at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless I force myself. As I discussed in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/magic&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; today, one of the things that makes us pro is not rolling with the punches (that’s avoidance), but rather instilling discipline in ourselves. Discipline surrounding every aspect of our lives. We cannot be disciplined in only one area of our lives, but all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring this back around to commutes, like I was originally discussing, long commutes suck but they only suck because they’re not being used to their full potential. Sleeping on the bus is not a productive use of your time. If you can’t sleep in, go to bed earlier. If you can’t go to bed earlier, go to bed at a decent time and wake up at a time in which you’re sleeping at your lightest. It might suck if that time is an hour earlier than what you wanted. If that’s the case, deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being flexible is part of the gig. Also sticking to your guns. And discipline. If you get up at the last minute because you want those “extra snoozes” (which are useless, by the way), you’re doing yourself a disservice. Find your light sleep time and get up with that. Do your typical morning routine and when you’re done, see how much extra time you have. Put that time to good use. Do what I do and write a blog post. Or don’t, it doesn’t matter. Just do something besides sit around and watch the news. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the kid excuse doesn’t work. if your kids are a distraction in the morning, wake up before them. They need more sleep than you, so you don’t have much of an excuse, there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We blame our long commutes for not having enough time to do things, yet we some how seem to be able to make time on one side of them, every single day. If we made time on the other side of them, we wouldn’t be complaining. When I get off this bus, I’m done with this task. I’m moving on to another. I’ve established this time for the purpose of writing and that’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can do this, you can, too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Magic</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/17/magic/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/17/magic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=johnatlymanco-20&amp;amp;linkId=BURAGZCYG4C3ERC5&quot;&gt;Pressfield&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the pro mindset is a discipline that we use to overcome Resistance . To defeat the self-sabotaging habits of procrastination, self-doubt, susceptibility to distraction, perfectionism, and shallowness, we enlist the self-strengthening habits of order, regularity, discipline, and a constant striving after excellence.Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something we tend to do a lot, especially when the waters aren’t smooth sailing. It involves justifying mediocrity, delaying, and otherwise finding excuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about excuses for why X isn’t done on time, or why you forgot Y at the grocery store. I’m talking about excuses for ourselves. Excuses for our behaviors. Excuses for our amateur-ness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolution is simple. Rules. Routine. +1-ing the day before. It’s easy to say “I’ll do it tomorrow,” and God knows I’m guilty of that like none other, but fixing that is simple: combat procrastination with scheduling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I schedule a lot of my tasks at work and firmly believe that extending that scheduling to my personal life can make a big difference. For example: I’ve been meaning to clean up my car a bit. It’s getting dirty on the inside. Unfortunately, I don’t drive it much during the week so it’s been put by the wayside. If I were to block out an hour of time this weekend to take care of that, I’d be more likely to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can combat perfectionism by understanding the concept of striving for excellence. Let me tell you something. If you ever plan on finishing that one thing you’ve been working on for months but feel it has to be just right, you’re never going to get it done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way you’ll be able to get that thing out there and improve for the next is to let it go. Don’t throw it away, but let go of the idea that if you just tweak that one thing in that one place, it’ll be magically perfect. Pro tip: that’s a whack expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic isn’t real. It’s illusionary in nature. Magic shows trick your mind into seeing and believing what’s not real. At the same time, we also trick ourselves into believing what we want by way of all of the above. We become distracted by the fluff and the illusionary perfectionism that we forget what’s actually going on behind the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you plan on being a magician, ditch the magic.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Triple Digits on Earth</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/16/triple-digits/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/16/triple-digits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve always found so amazing is that with today’s excellent blend of technologies to keep people living longer, we regularly see people living past 100 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How do you live to be 109 years old? Exercise, a nice warm bowl of porridge, and staying away from men—at least that’s the explanation given by Scotland’s oldest woman, Jessie Gallan, in a story that  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2912299/Scotland-s-oldest-woman-Jessie-Gallan-reveals-longevity-secrets-including-eating-porridge-avoiding-men.html&quot;&gt;went viral earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/15/how-the-world-s-oldest-people-live-so-long.html&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite wild to think that there’s a possibility I might live to be that long. Shortly after that realization another one hits: I’m going to need to save more for retirement. Most retirement plans account for 20-30 years between retirement and death. If I want to stick to my valiant plans of retiring at 55, I’m going to need more than that. If I’m Jessie, I’ll need 50 years. Oh boy. Good thing there are services to help manage money out there. I’m not sure I could do that on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not even going to start on the age of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2572316/The-secret-long-life-Sushi-sleep-according-worlds-oldest-woman.html&quot;&gt;oldest living woman&lt;/a&gt; at 118 years. I just can’t. It’s daunting to think that there’s so much more life left to live after retirement for some people. Usually when you reach that point, things change and daily life changes. I don’t think I could deal with that for over 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, I could just retire later, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s so long from now, God only knows what’ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Open-Source SageTV</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/16/sage/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/16/sage</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Comcast, I hope you’re reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SageTV founder (and current Google employee) Jeffrey Kardatzke says that Google “has agreed to open-source the SageTV platform.”[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/16/google-open-sourcing-sage-tv/?ncid=rss_truncated&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unfamiliar, SageTV has been off the market for a few years now after being one of the first to release a DVR box and home theater PC software title. Google bought it up and pulled it away, only to end up using it in their Google Fiber TV box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to see this kind of move. There’s a lot of capability in set top boxes that go untouched. I can speak from experience with my X1 box from Comcast. I have HDMI in and out, of which I can only use the OUT. I also have USB and Ethernet, both of which do nothing. I would love to be able to use the ethernet jack instead. It would behoove Comcast to switch to an IPTV-type setup, instead. The bandwidth of traditional cable (QAM256) is limited to something like 39mbps per channel, and each channel is typically split in half (since there aren’t enough channels in the spectrum for 1:1 usage). That brings us down to 19.8mbps per channel, at max. That’s not bad, but it could be better. Blu-Ray discs are usually 25-35mbps for video and roughly 5-8mbps for audio. Compressed 5.1 is roughly 1.5mbps so taking that out of our 19.8mbps stream leaves us with 18.3mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough about that. I can ramble about the quality of a TV signal all day. The point is that each stream could be any number of bits in size, not just a technological maximum of 19.8mbps. The trick would be switching streams in a timely manner and implementing some pretty hardcore QoS all along the pipe to ensure the TV signal doesn’t become degraded because your kids are having a LAN party in their room and sucking up all the Internets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without a move to IPTV, opening up a box to other apps and developers would make for a much more desirable platform, regardless of the vendor. One thing I’ve always wanted on my X1 was a Netflix app. Will that happen? Probably not, so long as Comcast has a beef with Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick will be to not let too many crazy things through the flood gates. If app developers start making shoddy apps, the quality of service for the entire system becomes compromised, and we know how Google loves to keep Android and open platform and what that ultimately does for the quality of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can’t think yourself out of a writing block; you have to write yourself out of a thinking block.  — &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)&quot; title=&quot;John Rogers&quot;&gt;John Rogers&lt;/a&gt;These words are very true, and I have the experience to back them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I spent 30 minutes &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half-hour&quot; title=&quot;Half Hour of Random&quot;&gt;writing non-stop&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t think about what I was writing, nor did I stop to even see if what I wrote flowed. At the end, I just published it. The premise behind that exercise was to not just pad my monthly word count, but to simply see what ideas come to mind as I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was quite interesting. There were clear transitions between topics, but each of those topics was a morph from the one previous. It’s as though when I was discussing one thing, another idea started forming in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another prime example is just today when I was discussing &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/sage&quot; title=&quot;Open-Source SageTV&quot;&gt;SageTV&lt;/a&gt;. I started going on about QAM 256 and channel bandwidth and other non-related stuff all to come back to the point of there being better ways to go about executing a set top box in 2015 like what Google’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)&quot; title=&quot;John Rogers&quot;&gt;Rogers&lt;/a&gt; is talking about. I could easily have another couple posts right there about things I have at least some knowledge of. I could explain the intricacies of QAM and bore the hell out of you. I could also explain why open-sourcing a set-top box is both a great and a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I will. Who knows. The point is that I wouldn’t have even thought of those topics to talk about had I not written about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the many reasons why I like writing on a regular basis. There isn’t some massive end-goal in mind. I’m not trying to build a mega-blog full of money-making ideas that I can litter with ads and end up in a penthouse. Not even close. I write because it stimulates my mind and gives me new things to talk about and new ideas to ponder. There isn’t another medium of creativity where I’ve been able to work out how to write at a pace of almost 3500 words an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say I should really write a book.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Voyager 1 and 2. Covering a million miles a day, these two crafts are still humming along. After 40 years of travel, they still gather data, and some of the original crew still watch over them… even if they do so from a simple office park in Pasadena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/15/voyager-1-and-2-space-journey-nasa&quot;&gt;Reading about Steve Howard&lt;/a&gt;, 65, the man who’s in a group of people controlling the space crafts from 16 light hours away, is quite humbling. Voyager 1 took a “family photo” of the solar system 25 years ago and in 2036, will shut down. Most sensors will do so long before the nine 2025 as its Plutonium-238 reactor dwindles into nothingness, but an eleven more years is still an impressive feat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard will be 90 by then. There isn’t much of a change either Voyager will find anything super interesting until 40,000 years from now, when they’ll be dead metal and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you complain your internet is slow, think about Steve and his 17 34 hour round-trip transmission time from his computer, through the Deep Space Network, to Voyager 1. &lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/14/wordpress-hosting-series</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been mulling this idea over in my head for a few weeks, now and now I think it’s time to start it. I’m starting a series of posts on various managed WordPress offerings and my impressions of them. Since I run a WordPress site by hand, I believe it’ll allow me to have a fair point of view when it comes to transitioning to a managed service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ll be looking for is a roughly the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signup Process. How easy was it to sign up for the service?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Migration. How much time would it take to migrate a site and if it costs more, how much extra?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching. How easy it is to go live from the time the account becomes active?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra Features. Are things like SSL and CDNs included? Are they limited to certain plans? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Price Point. How much would it cost to get into the service?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free Trials. This is a big one for a lot of people. Does the service have a free trial that can be exercised? 
Here’s a list of the services I plan on going over in the next month or so:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flywheel&lt;br /&gt;
Kinsta&lt;br /&gt;
Pagely&lt;br /&gt;
MediaTemple&lt;br /&gt;
DreamHost&lt;br /&gt;
Pantheon&lt;br /&gt;
WPEngine&lt;br /&gt;
WordPress.com&lt;br /&gt;
Synthesis&lt;br /&gt;
Pressable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other services you’d like to see covered, please let me know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every cloud storage provider has a variety of changing promos that can give you extra storage space, so it’s always worthwhile to keep an ear to the ground. Some of the promotions we mention here may change over time, but they’ll also likely be replaced by something else. Cloud storage providers seem to like giving away space like candy if it means new customers.Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drippler.com/drip/how-maximize-your-free-storage-space-every-cloud-service&quot;&gt;full article, here&lt;/a&gt;!

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If only there was something like this when I was getting out of high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeschool.com&quot;&gt;Make School&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Imagine going to a school where everyone is trying to change the world with technology. Welcome to Make School. Your education will be focused on building apps and websites that improve the lives of those around you. You’ll learn the underlying computer science theory, development best practices and design principles that enable you to ship polished products.&amp;gt; You’ll start a company, work on teams, contribute to open source software and intern at a tech startup, all in 2 years. You’ll improve your storytelling, writing, pitching, and learn the social engineering needed to excel as a founder or climb a corporate ladder. You’ll culminate your experience with a 2 month capstone project where you can build a startup or dive deep into computer science topics like artificial intelligence and machine learning.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeschool.com&quot;&gt;Make School&lt;/a&gt; was featured in Fast Company when they featured a kid fresh out of high school who could have gone to MIT. Even before finishing, he was already jumping into the real world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One month shy of officially finishing  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/organization/make-school&quot;&gt;Make School&lt;/a&gt;’s course—which included iOS,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/programminglanguage/ruby-on-rails&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/explore/web-development&quot;&gt;web development&lt;/a&gt;—Bando’s preliminary job hunt yielded an offer for a  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/explore/software-engineering-position&quot;&gt;software engineering position&lt;/a&gt; at  &lt;a href=&quot;https://papaly.com/&quot;&gt;Papaly&lt;/a&gt;, a  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/explore/social-bookmarking-startup&quot;&gt;social bookmarking startup&lt;/a&gt;, at a salary just north of $90,000.[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/3043275/my-creative-life/how-one-high-school-grad-studied-computer-science-debt-free-and-nabbed-a-90?partner=rss&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll say again: where was this when I was finishing high school? &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest of the article from Fast Company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/3043275/my-creative-life/how-one-high-school-grad-studied-computer-science-debt-free-and-nabbed-a-90?partner=rss&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeschool.com&quot;&gt;Make School&lt;/a&gt;. Both are good choices, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting Started with Loggly</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/14/loggly-start/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/14/loggly-start</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love logs. I love massive amounts of data. I have this thing where if I feel I can consume and process tons of data by doing something menial and useless, I’ll do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I don’t really do though is keep tabs on the logs for my site and its services. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;http://loggly.com&quot;&gt;Loggly&lt;/a&gt; comes in, and this is my experience getting it set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signing up was pretty easy. I just went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://loggly.com&quot;&gt;loggly.com,&lt;/a&gt; clicked Sign Up in the top right corner, filled out a few things, and waited patiently while their systems used magic fairy dust and unicorn blood to construct my logging instance. They provide a full 30-day trial that gives a user full access to all features to determine if it’s really right for them. After 30 days, it drops down to their limited free tier, which is still good for small people like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this as I go through their service, so let’s take a moment to talk about what Loggly actually does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole goal of Loggly is to provide centralized log management without the need for agents. This allows sysadmins or anybody who cares to view and track log data in real time. You can search through logs as they come in and graph out instances of particular events to track down issues as they’re happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logy allows you to track logs from almost any source. Their list is pretty exhaustive if you ask me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apache&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nginx&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IIS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tomcat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microsoft SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Django&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PHP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Java&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node.JS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;.NET&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docket&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Puppet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chef&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FluentD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AWS Cloudtrail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AWS S3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and Heroku
That really is a pretty big list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that you can get started for free than that there’s a free tier, but let’s talk about what that actually means and the other options that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free tier gives you the basics including searching and filters, persistent workspaces, and built-in alerting. The standard tier ($49/month) gives you 1GB/day of log storage and 7-day retention, unlimited users, built-in alerting, customized dashboards, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the Pro tier is where you start getting some of the more tasty features.  You get peak overage protection, AWS S3 archiving, telephone support, and more. The default plan grants 15 days of retention at $109/month, but if you need more than that, you’re more than welcome to it: 10GB/day for $499, 50GB/day for $2500 and more. If 50GB/day and $2500 sounds like a lot, don’t worry, it is. 50GB of log files in a day though is a lot and if you need that kind of support, you’re not too worried about the price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of this post is to follow after my account is set up… see you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting Started with Loggly Part 2: The Cool Stuff!</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/14/loggly-part-2/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/14/loggly-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of part 1: &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/loggly-start&quot;&gt;Getting Started with Loggly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Apparently waiting hours for account generation isn’t a thing according to the fine folks on twitter @loggly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/theeJL&quot;&gt;@theeJL&lt;/a&gt; Creation takes a few sec so likely something happened during form validation. Perhaps try again or DM us the subdomain you typed in— Loggly, Inc. (@loggly) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/loggly/status/576938047004024832&quot;&gt;March 15, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re signed up, let’s get down to the good stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to do is start tracking Linux. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/stack&quot;&gt;core of my site&lt;/a&gt; is Ubuntu (among other things). Loggly makes this easy. All I need to do is click the Linux icon on my account’s main page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1419.52.30.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.01.19.png?resize=693%2C433&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is as simple as copying the two lines of code and running them with superuser access. Within a few seconds, Loggly grabbed a hold and started showing me cool stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.05.00.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty empty now, because I literally just started tracking and I’m only tracking Linux. With time this will become more populated and more interesting to parse through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to other applications, now. I want to start tracking nginx. Nginx is just one of the apps Loggly can track. The list is massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.06.39.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting Nginx set up was just as easy as Linux, although Loggly believed my Nginx logs weren’t of a proper format. No matter, they’re coming in great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting MySQL set up isn’t a one-click process like the others. This requires MySQL to do some extra work and get a bit re-configured. No worries, it’s nothing extravagant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up PHP was a breeze, and I like a good breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything was added like I wanted, I started poking through my logs to see if I could really find good data without hassle. Turns out, I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s better than watching someone from China try to hack into your system via SSH by trying to log in as the root user?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.25.24.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing &lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend Loggly to anyone who wants to consolidate and be able to parse and search through their log data. You might not need the heavy plans, I know I don’t. It’s still good to be able to look at events as they happen in real time with an interface that doesn’t suck and from anywhere in the world without having to log into your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://loggly.com&quot;&gt;Loggly&lt;/a&gt;, right now. You’ll enjoy it, for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. It keeps track of all sorts of goodies for me. The thing I like the most and really appreciate is the visitor tracking. I like knowing how many people visit my site on a regular basis. I don’t use much outside those base features, though. Good thing there’s an app for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/logo_black.png?resize=301%2C89&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;There’s a sick little iPhone and OS X app called &lt;a href=&quot;http://gagetapp.com&quot;&gt;GAget&lt;/a&gt;. It’s sole purpose is to provide you with just-the-meat of your &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; data including visitor sessions, bounce rate, new visitor percentage, and visit length. On iOS, this comes in the form of a super clean app that you can scroll though. On OS X, it’s a notification center widget. Both are super sexy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend you check it out on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget-simple-widget-for-google/id968487158?mt=12&quot;&gt;OS X App Store&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99) or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget/id716442061&quot;&gt;iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; ($1.99).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Write What You Know</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/12/write/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/12/write</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And write what you don’t know in hopes that one day you’ll learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Write what you know, write what you want to know more about. Write what you’re afraid to write about. – Cec MurphyThere are several topics I can think of off the top of my head that spark my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, I’d like to learn more about app development. I have a grand idea (that I’ll share in a future post) that would make a dorky but amusing app. It wouldn’t make me any money, and that’s not the idea. The goal is to say I did it. Those are all awesome things to write about. One could create an entire blog about the process and have tens or hundreds of posts throughout the course of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration is another good one. I just finished listening to The Martian by Andy Weir and loved every minute of it. What I enjoyed most wasn’t the premise or how amusing the characters were, but the style of writing. (Spoilers, maybe) The main character is stuck on Mars, and a lot of the story is told from his point of view. The only way to do that while still keeping it somewhat realistic is by way of mission logs. Every day, Mark Watney logs his activities and his thoughts in hopes that someone will read or listen to them. Why not take a similar approach to a blog about traveling? Instead of recapping a course of events after the fact, write them down as they happen? Have a ton of little posts that go into detail. Pretend you’re alone on Mars, if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third idea is to write about something you are frankly afraid to know more about. If you’re religious, write about science that defies your beliefs. Inversely, if you’re an atheist, do the opposite. If at some point it becomes uncomfortable, write about that, too. You don’t have to convert at the end, but at least give yourself an opportunity to see things from the other side. Don’t be close-minded. I know too many people who are and subsequently can’t have deep, ponderous conversations with them. That makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At no point does any new thing you write about have to be permanent. Once you start writing about politics, you don’t have to keep it up. Just do it for an election season. If doesn’t have to be news reporting, either. Opinion pieces are all the rage and likely to be consumed more by those who share a similar opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about what you’re writing. Is it challenging you in any way? If the answer’s ‘no,’ perhaps you’ve become too comfortable in what you write about. Personally, I try to write more about technical topics that are of interest but I’m not necessarily an expert because it also helps me think about them more. I get an opportunity to do research and gives me a good outlet to express my findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you’re thinking about what to write, think about what you know nothing about. Think about something you don’t like. Think about something you know nothing about that you don’t like. You’ll find something juicy in there, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Remotely Working</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/12/remotely-working/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/12/remotely-working</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With all the impressive technology we have today, one thing I’m surprised is still as ancient as it is is strict requirements on committing to an office every day to do work. There are a lot of jobs that don’t really require you to be in an expensive building. Off the top of my head, I can think of several jobs that would thrive remotely: software development, sales, support, devops, operations, accounting, and anything else where the majority of work is done on a computer. One can’t reasonably expect manufacturing to be done from home, but isn’t it all the same when you write code on your computer at work versus on your computer at home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one guy, it’s not. In fact, he’s quite adamant that working remotely is detrimental to a company’s success. Someone should show him how well &lt;a href=&quot;http://automattic.com&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bufferapp.com&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And my COO felt performance was slipping. Revenues were dipping by about $100,000 per month. While some people on our team do a great job no matter what, he felt others would benefit from closer supervision. At home, it’s easy to get distracted by tasks like feeding the dog or surfing the Web. Some team members’ performance evaluations were declining. Their follow-up on projects was sometimes slower than we wanted.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/id/102460256&quot;&gt;[s]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that even a thing? Hiring quality people should include screening for poor work-from-home performance. The cool thing about working from home is that you can break up tasks throughout the the day and be able to do stuff like feeding the dog, something that takes a whole three minutes. Also… employees surf the web at work. People don’t need to wait until the get home to do that. Sorry, bud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe that someone could be so closed-minded in 2015. Actually, it’s not. Looking into the author, and reading some of the comments about him tells us he’s not even close to a good source of information on the subject. After I read the article, I pondered it for a bit. It felt so incredibly out of place. It was almost like something synthetic that was created for a specific purpose, and that purpose wasn’t to share genuine ideas. The article felt like it was written to prove a point to someone that the author’s idea was legitimate because without it, they would look like a fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the comments revealed all. I’ll let you read them for yourself if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the original topic, though. If a company can figure out how to distribute itself in some capacity, cost savings could be had. The amount of necessary office space would shrink, salaries can flex based on the area the remote worker lives in (The media home price in San Francisco is almost five times that of Atlanta, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the while, without having to fork over extra money, the savings can be put to better use like higher quality medical benefits, more paid time off, and company outings or retreats. As much as I’d like to go into the numbers, I frankly don’t have the time or resources to do so. Fortunately for me, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; did the work, already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you’re job searching, think about working remotely. You might be surprised at what you could find. To get started here’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://weworkremotely.com&quot;&gt;a great site of remote jobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>DevOps</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/12/devops/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/12/devops</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not news anymore, but I thought it’d be worth mentioning real quick before I continue. I’m moving in the next couple months. In fact, as I write this, I have less than two months. The week of May 10th is when we’re slated to pack up our house and shift it south two states. That might not seem like a lot, but I’ve never lived outside of the Seattle area, let alone a thousand miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I just wanted to reflect for a minute on my job hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one thing that will always be in the back of my mind no matter where I’m looking for a job: competition. The economy is either doing well or poorly, depending on which political side you stand, but that doesn’t affect the number of people looking for a job. I’m specifically talking about the number of people looking for a a tech job, in a tech hub known as the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, there are a load of opportunities available, but there’s a trend with a lot of them: if you’re a college graduate who can program anything with your eyes closed, you’re hired. That’s what’s in nowadays. I’m not one of those people, and I’m ok with that. I don’t know if I’ll ever be a die-hard software developer. I like backends. I guess we can refer to that as DevOps, a term that until about 2010, was probably just made up mumbo jumbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps is a blend of software development and behind-the-scenes operations stuff. Think about the guys who make the internal tools in your company that allow you to do what you do. Those are DevOps guys. If you’re a software developer, think about the guys that made all the tools you use to validate, build, and test. In some shops, those are done in house… by the DevOps guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps is a field that’s quite popular. You don’t have to be a wizard in a given language, but you need to know your stuff. There’s a lot of thinking on your feet and new challenges will always arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I want to be. I have a really great idea in my mind on a platform that gives you the power of DevOps without needing a ton of staff and man hours to make your backend needs happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to have something launched in the next five years. That’d be really exciting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Half Hour of Random</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/11/half-hour/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/11/half-hour</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought of a new way to spur creativity when writing. Carve out a chunk of time, and within that block you chose, write. No stops, no going back to link things, no erasing and starting over. Just write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds easy doesn’t it? No? It’s hard? Never. It’s only hard if you think you can’t do it. Remember the whole thing around failure I’ve been talking about? I’m pretty sure you’re psyching yourself out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t caught on yet, writing is a great way to get your ideas out, process your thoughts, and hash out any plans you might have. This means you could be writing something as simple as a set of instructions and only then would you realize that your process is flawed. If you hadn’t put those words down, would you have never known that you took the long way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get comfortable because we’re going to chat for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 is turning out to be an interesting year. Of course we have the typical talking points like Obamacare, the Middle East, the economy, and what the NSA is hacking now. All of that stuff should pale in comparison to one thing: what are you doing for 2015?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean what are your resolutions for 2015, I mean what are you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; doing? Your resolutions are likely just a bunch of crap anyway to make yourself feel better. What have you done so far to make &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you learn something new, yet? How about catching up on those books you’ve been meaning to read? (or listen to?) Did you finish that project that’s been sitting in your garage for the last three years? Your wife wants you to clean out the attic… did you find anything cool down there? Why haven’t you talked about it, yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on and really end up rambling, especially since everything I’ve written so far has only taken five minutes to type out. If I’m going to stick to that 30 minute rule, we have a lot of talking to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what would happen if I told you that the thing you performed most poorly at today can be the one thing you end up being the best at? I’m serious. I don’t know how to fix a car, but because of my desire to tinker and fix computers, I’m positive I would end up being a master at it, even though cars have super advanced computers and other technical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, let’s promise each other to never use the word super, again. It’s tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pondering the effects of binge watching on modern television. It probably didn’t help that I was pondering this while watching House of Cards, binge style. I re-signed up for Netflix just to watch the show and plan on canceling once I’m done, effectively working itself out so I only pay $9 for season three. There isn’t a single retailer that would sell House of Cards, digital or otherwise, for $9. Isn’t that crazy? Same goes for what will soon be HBO Now. Think about it. You could binge-watch Game of Thrones, all four current seasons, in roughly a month if you really dedicated time to it, and only pay $15. How much would each season on disc cost? For a blu-ray, probably $50-70 per season. DVDs might be around $30-45 a season. iTunes? Likely $40 a season. Isn’t that whack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s even worse is that people like me who get HBO at no additional charge with their cable subscription are essentially paying nothing for it. So far I’ve seen every episode of the first three seasons and haven’t paid a dime extra to do so. That’s the cheapest binge watching I’ve ever done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could probably also say a similar thing about Weeds when I used to have Showtime. I paid $0 for it, too, back in the day, and watched every episode. Crazy, right? I don’t own any of the seasons. I’ve never rented an episode. I paid zero dollars for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know what you’re thinking, somebody did actually end up paying for it. You’re right. Comcast paid a fee for it. They took a hit because I got those channels for free—and in the car of HBO, I still do until August 2016—and there’s no such thing as a free lunch… but there is when I didn’t pay for it. It was free to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to my next topic, 13 minutes in: free stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all like free stuff, don’t we. I sure do. Free services, free apps, free this and free that. I love food samples at Costco, BOGO sales… I could go on for a while. There’s something a lot of us forget, though. Free stuff comes with a price. You can get a free app on the App store, but more often than not, it’s probably showing ads. It might have been free for you, but the hours put into developing the app cost money. It cost time, resources, humans, food, you name it. None of that stuff was free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the opportunity to buy out the ads on an app so they don’t show again, you should do it. If you can’t afford the few dollars, you probably should be making cuts elsewhere, anyway. If you go to Starbucks and pay $5 for coffee every day, you can afford to buy an app. Plus it doesn’t hurt tom make your own coffee at home, anyway. Money saved all around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of making coffee at home, I love and hate my Keurig. I love it because it’s simple. I hate it because it’s expensive. Coffee cups for it cost way more than they should and they know they can get away with selling such small servings of black gold for such a high price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I’m lazy. I could buy beans or pre-ground coffee in a bag and save a ton of money a year (probably literally) but that means I have to take the time to ground my own coffee and use the little filter adapter thing the coffee maker comes with. No it’s not hard… I’m lazy, remember?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being lazy is a curse. It’s easy to be lazy if you’re use to it. Sometimes, you just don’t feel like doing a damn thing. I understand, there are days when I literally don’t do anything that doesn’t involve sleeping in a bed until noon on the weekends. After I get up, I quietly remind myself that I’m being lazy and I could have conquered just about everything on my todo list by that same time, but hindsight is 20/20 and blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about making a legit to-do list of things I need to take care of on a regular basis with one-time tasks included. For example, I need to wash my car, but I keep putting it off because there are a ton of other things I also want to do and I can do those other things at home. I’ve delegated myself to my house for weekend chores meanwhile other stuff outside the house becomes neglected… probably because I’m still being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t talk of someone turning pro. Remember those posts I wrote about that? I genuinely believe everything I said in each one of those posts, but to err is human. It’s easy to talk a big game about what we want to be. It takes a lot of work to actually get there. It also takes time. Time is money. Money is power. Turning pro is a powerful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I rambled enough, yet? I’m closing in on thirty minutes and it’s quite amusing to see how my train of thought shifted from one set of tracks to another. This is how my brain operates on any given day. I’m not ADHD, I’m not all over the place, I just ponder a lot of stuff. Most of the time the marathon of morphing thoughts happen when sleeping is of utmost importance. It’s this non-stop thought box that sometimes makes it hard for me to actually come up with something to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I focus too hard on any one thing I thought about during the day, I forget all about it. I have to catch it in its transient state and make note of it without putting too much effort into it or it’ll vanish like a wisp of non-existent metaphors and descriptors never meant to be consumed and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dang. Words. I wonder where they come from sometimes. I can go a whole day without saying a word to anybody with my mouth, but can put down thousands of words in text form. Sometimes I don’t feel like I have anything to say, but have a lot to talk about. I have a lot to express, but no words to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense? In the end, I don’t really care. that’s not what this exercise was about. It was about just letting things flow from my mind, through my hands, into my keyboard, and onto this digital paper-blog-thing. These are the ways ideas form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What starts as a ramble, ends in a story. What starts as an idea, becomes a masterpiece. Do you think Shakespeare was just sitting around taking a crap and all of a sudden the whole story of Romeo and Juliet just magically appeared in his head? I’d doubt that. Everyone has to start somewhere. I start by rambling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discussed several topics that by themselves seemed rather boring to me because I thought about them too much. I wanted to write a huge expose on binge watching on Netflix and the like but it just seemed dumb. Sure it’s a real thing and sure it’s worth talking about, but I’m not a journalist. I write because I can and because I want to, not because I have bills to pay. If I ever did that, I don’t know if my words would ever be genuine, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I lost that element in my writing, I don’t think I’d ever want to do it again, in any form. The only form of expression I have that has never failed me nor has ever been anything but consistent in nature would be gone. I’m not sure what i’d do then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe paint?&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-03-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/11/goodbye-dev-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought I would use it, I really did. I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; as a platform but it’s just not where I want it to be, right now. Perhaps in a year or so, I’ll give it another shot with serious intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://newrelic.com&quot;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; agent monitoring it sucks up memory like a Dyson vacuum. For an app that literally is doing nothing, New Relic’s NodeJS agent sure seems to look like it’s doing a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, I need my RAM back. It’s nothing personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I really like New Relic as a whole. They watch over my PHP environment, nginx and MySQL servers, and my server as a whole on the resource and load level for free. That’s pretty good in my book. Plus, all those agents seem to be playing nice, so they can stay.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apple Watch</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/11/apple-watch/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/11/apple-watch</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch was formally announced on Monday. Part of me cares, part of me doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of the Apple Watch. I like the way the stainless steel watch with the metal link band looks. I buy regular watches that look like that. Too bad it’s $1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be hard for me to justify that kind of price tag. I look at what the Apple Watch allegedly can do, and I think to myself that I’d never use any of that. I like the idea of fitness trackers, and I like watches. If the Apple Watch was half the price, if I could get the watch I described for $500, instead, I’d buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I can’t, though, I’m looking for alternatives. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;http://withings.com&quot;&gt;Withings&lt;/a&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6.Withings_Activite_silver_side.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6.Withings_Activite_silver_side-1024x683.png?resize=660%2C440&quot; alt=&quot;6.Withings_Activite_silver_side.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really enjoying the look of the Activité. It’s a simple device that does exactly what I want at a price tag that’s reasonable. The analog style is great and the battery life is outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never 100% liked having a watch on one hand, and a FitBit on the other. I like my FitBit, but I’d like to wear it on my left arm… except my watch is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smell a birthday gift to myself coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my wife ever reads this: Wife, this is what I want for my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Stack</title>

   <updated>2015-03-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/10/stack</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday someone asked me what my stack looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I think it makes a good blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always open to share the tech behind my sites and this one is no different. While not incredibly in depth, here’s how it goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-1-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Layer 1: Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of it all is DigitalOcean. They provide the resources my site sits on and so far they’re doing amazingly well. If I ever need more space or resources, I just need to click a few buttons and I’m on my way. I could also set up load balancing, too, with little effort if it comes to that. Their claim to fame are their awesome little (or big) droplets that start at $5. For $5 you get 512mb of RAM 20GB of SSD-backed storage, and 1TB of bandwidth. That’s enough for a small, site, for sure. I’ve moved higher than that mainly because of one member of my software stack that naturally uses more RAM. I’ll cover it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-2-operating-system&quot;&gt;Layer 2: Operating System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within my DigitalOcean home, Ubuntu 14.04 sits. I’ve chosen the LTS branch because I’m very much of a set-and-forget mentality when it comes to supporting architecture. I like the idea of not having to worry about my OS becoming outdated in a short window of time. It’ll effectively be supported until 16.04 comes out, and to give you an idea of when that is, 14.10 is currently the newest in line and 15.04 isn’t slated until the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-developments-15-04-beta-1-and-the-first-ubuntu-phone/&quot;&gt;end of April&lt;/a&gt; for a release date. In essence, I’m good until at least April 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-3-web-server&quot;&gt;Layer 3: Web Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting all of these bits is hard work. That’s why I chose nginx to take up the task. It’s a great server application that I’ve combined with SSL to make every visit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jlyman.net&quot;&gt;https://jlyman.net&lt;/a&gt; secure. Minimal configuration is needed in order to make things hum along smoothly, and I’m glad for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-4-12-interpreter&quot;&gt;Layer 4 1/2: Interpreter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP. Given I run WordPress, this is a given. However there are several ways to run it. In my case, I’ve taken then PHP5-FPM route. I could also use FastCGI (the more generic form of FPM) or MOD_PHP (which is actually not that fast in today’s environments). FPM allows me to keep PHP from sucking up too many resources and limiting its worker count. If something gets stuck, I can gracefully shut it down and bring it back up without any major headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-4-22-database&quot;&gt;Layer 4 2/2: Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is also a given because I run WordPress. MySQL is on the back side hosting the actual content of this site. It’s backed up every hour for good measure and backups are stored in a safe place that can be reached via the outside. There are much more efficient databases however getting WordPress to work with them is rough going if not impossible at this time and I don’t see much changing any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-5-wordpress&quot;&gt;Layer 5: WordPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the cream on top. WordPress is my CMS of choice and it’s one I’ve used for several years. I remember when I first started using it back on version 2.5. WordPress has come a very long way and I’m grateful that development of such a product continues today with a massive community behind it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layer-6-cloudflare--ssl&quot;&gt;Layer 6: CloudFlare + SSL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, CloudFlare + SSL takes care of all my caching needs. They’re very intelligent about what can be cached and what’s dynamic. I have yet to run into a case where stale content has been served. With their system comes continued use of SSL. This means that from the server to their server is secure, and from their server to you is also secure, no questions. DDoS efforts are limited quickly and geographic-dependencies are removed. Wherever you are, you’ll get quick load times and a lot of burden is taken off my system, which keeps my costs low. I love keeping costs low.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Like a Girl</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/07/like-a-girl/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/07/like-a-girl</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on this kick for the last few days about women in the software development world, or even the lack thereof. Some of it is based off of what I’ve witnessed, and some of it comes from personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in an environment that’s mostly men. I also work in a rather large company that has several buildings where people get shuffled around from time to time. Recently, a new team took up some empty space in my building and after seeing our new tech residents, I became disappointed with what crossed my mind: “wow… she’s a developer?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve effectively made you think I’m a complete douche and that I think women should be in the kitchen, let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I think the level of female participation in STEM careers is awesome, especially technical fields like software development. There are a lot of bright female minds out there that I’m sure have crazy cool ideas and are just as good if not better at programming than a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reflected a bit on what happened and I came to realize, that thought didn’t cross my mind because she’s a woman, but because she wasn’t nerdy-looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a society, we’ve developed a stigma with software developers that they’re typically the nerdiest of the group and spend all of their time in front of a computer screen “hacking” or some crap like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a man might not care so much about his image, a woman most likely will. To be feminine in a technical role is to ask for trouble. Take this particular article on Medium titled “ &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@sailorhg/coding-like-a-girl-595b90791cce&quot;&gt;Coding Like a Girl&lt;/a&gt;.” I wanted to pick it apart for a bit and point out some rather sad truths about the state of the developer union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many people, when meeting me and hearing my profession, tell me that I look like a designer, someone in accounting, someone in marketing, anything but a programmer.This. If nothing else sticks through the rest of this post, consume this sentence. We’ve crafted an ideal female in various positions. In marketing, she’s probably going to be hot, skinny, likely blonde, and can sell you the air you’re already breathing. She knows how to pitch a new product and she makes good eye candy for the guys. If she was a developer, though, she’s probably just wearing a Zelda t-shirt and jeans, because that’s just what developers do, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/triketora&quot;&gt;Tracy Chou&lt;/a&gt;, an engineer at Pinterest, shared this story with me: A couple years ago she attended a technical conference and on the first day, she wore a dress. When she walked around the conference, no one came up to talk to her. When she asked people very technical questions about their stack, questions she assumed would indicate that she was a programmer, she was brushed aside and told, “ &lt;strong&gt;You wouldn’t understand&lt;/strong&gt;.” She went back home that night really frustrated and flustered. She almost didn’t feel like going to the conference the next day. But she did and wore a nerdy t-shirt and jeans instead, and she had a better experience that day. People assumed she was technical and didn’t dilute their explanations to her.Not only have we come to a point where people can’t be pretty, but now they’re pretty stupid. It’s sad, really. I added my own emphasis to the above story because I want that statement to stick out. Telling someone they wouldn’t understand, regardless if they’re a woman or a man or a five year old is degrading. If you’ve told someone that, go die. I’ll admit, I’ve said that myself, and I hate myself for it. It’s an old habit that needs to die super hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who cares if someone doesn’t understand. Don’t be a pompous asshole and explain it to them. You never know the level of curiosity or interest someone has. Maybe you’ll end up being the gateway for them to broaden their skill set or learn something new. Instead, you just put them down. Way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author goes on to talk about how people have said to her that acting like a woman is distracting. When I read this part, I actually chuckled a little bit that someone would even say that. I’m not entirely sure what do say about this besides something along the lines of “keep it in your pants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to let you finish reading the article yourself, because I think it’s important that you get this from the source, from someone who’s experienced this firsthand. I’m a guy, so I’ll never know what it’s like to end up feeling second-class just because I have boobs. Yeah, I have boobs, but my wife isn’t dying to see them, if you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the women out there who are actively pursuing what they want and aren’t fussing over making sure they don’t look too good or who aren’t dumbing down themselves and their looks to fit in and not rock the boat, good for you. Feminism was created out of the exact issues you’re going against. Instead of conforming, continue reforming.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Failure, Part 3</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/07/failure-part-3/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/07/failure-part-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I discussed a recent failure of mine that hit home pretty hard. You can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/failure&quot; title=&quot;Recovering from Failure&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/failure-part-2&quot; title=&quot;Recovering From Failure, Part 2&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, first, if you’d like, but it’s not necessary. Today another important event happened that goes well with this impromptu series I’ve started and I want to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day contains a new measure of varying successes. From the very beginning whether we get up in the morning on time and how many times we hit the snooze button, to whether we make it to work on time because of an accident on the freeway, to if we prepared enough for the meeting with the big cheeses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest about something. Failure isn’t a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa, wait what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says who?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who’s “failed” many times you and I should very well know by now that sometimes shit happens. That doesn’t make any one thing a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define failure as a threshold. Beyond X percentage of things going according to plan, we’re succeeding at something. Below X, we’re failing. This starts early in life with school. The archaic grading system we still use today—because if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right?…right?…guys?—tells us if we’re 100% correct on whatever menial task we’re completing, we’re performing admirably. If we only complete 59%, we’re failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m no rocket scientist but I think we’re on to something and it’s surely not rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rather feudal method of ranking each other sets everyone up for failure. We carry it through life and it becomes how we go about our day. Maybe we’re not getting a grade on how quickly we showered, but we’re still looking internally and ranking ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just use the words “today sucked.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have this system so ingrained in our minds and in our ways of life that after a point, we just say “I give up” or “I’m over it.” It becomes easy to care none because we not only have this mindless scale, but we automatically think that once we cross the point of no return, it’s better to blow the rest off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would certainly be the case in school if you didn’t have a passing grade and there wasn’t enough time or “things” left to do to possibly raise the score… 20th century education at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep going back and bashing on the educational system and in all honesty, that wasn’t my original goal when I started writing this. Things just kind of turned that way as the pieces started falling into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure is a completely synthetic thing. Failure is only measurable because we as humans believe we need to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about everything we have and interact with that measures failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performance Reviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Report Cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Credit Reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance Rates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incarceration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Counseling
I bet you’d love to shoot back at me with a million reason why each one of those don’t actually measure failure, and I’d be interested to hear what you have to say. I was going to originally break down each one of these things but I really don’t think it’s necessary. I made the list to prove a point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives rotate around not failing, and failing is how we learn. We complete a task or an action and don’t do well at it, so we figure out what we did wrong and continue. We shouldn’t dwell on the idea that a particular thing takes time to master and in the meantime, we’re sub-par. No one is a master of anything overnight. No one is a master of anything even over two nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you tell yourself: “I wish I could just do today over,” let me know so I can slap you. You can go ahead and be a little bitch about it or you can just keep moving. You of all people should care the least if you haven’t mastered the day. Continue doing you and don’t worry about the rest. If you’re learning a new language, just keep working on it. If you’re trying to get into graduate school, just keep applying. If you’re developing a new app and don’t feel like it’ll meet everyone’s standards and would rather play video games because at least there you don’t get to see utter failure in the form of bad reviews, I’m sorry to say it but you need to nut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best things you have in life are the ones you worked the hardest for. You’ll value them the most and you’ll appreciate having them around. This goes for people, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you tell yourself you failed, tell yourself instead that you’ll be better at it tomorrow. Yoda tells us there is no “try.” That cat was right.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using Words</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/06/words/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/06/words</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve always struggled with just a bit is my ability to translate my thoughts into words. When I write them down, I typically don’t have a problem. When it comes to speaking them, that’s where I falter from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when I’ve been sitting in interviews and feel myself slipping into utter destruction and the only way to pull myself out was to craft some kind of visual aid. If I’m in a meeting room with a whiteboard, I’ll definitely take advantage of that because when I can draw out or otherwise illustrate what I’m trying to convey, I have a much better time actually saying it. A couple years ago, I had a technical interview that I would have otherwise failed if I hadn’t be able to illustrate the processes I was trying to describe that I was making up in my head as I went along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are really good with speaking. I’m not one of those people. What I want to say and what actually comes out are two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t even get me started on trying to start a presentation or other conversation where a lot of people are intently listening to me and waiting for words to come out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if I had a to write a lengthly technical description of something, I’d bust it out in no time. As I’m writing this in fact, I’m not even looking at my screen, but instead outside the bus window at the traffic passing by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews have always been a struggle for me because there are so many things I want to say but being able to organize them as they come out verbally is something I’m not quite sure how to fix. When I’m interviewing with someone, I try to make it clear that my strength in explaining things lies with my words on paper (digital or otherwise). I can write directions for anything in a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one key that makes this so easy for me: I can go back and review it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try not to edit my words as much as possible. Whatever I put down is typically the truth, even if it sounds shitty or a bit off. And when I say the truth, I mean the unfiltered thought. I don’t typically go back and censor what I’m saying either. I don’t have time nor do I actually care to. All I want to do is tell the world what I’m thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder if I should write technical documents for a living. Become a technical writer. I’m sure I’d do pretty well at that. I write a lot of documentation for the team I work on and manage on a regular basis. I’ve single-handedly created processes that people now blindly follow without a second guess because they believe that what I’m saying is true and is right. No one questions the directions I give them if I give them said directions written out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get funny looks if I tell them how to do something verbally, though, and I totally understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on situations like that, I realize I get ahead of myself in the process as I work through it in my head. Once I speak the words of event think about them, I’m already onto the next step. As I write, I can’t do that. I’m focused on placing one sentence at a time onto the digital or physical paper and don’t move on until I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some would describe that as a very small sign of a mental disorder. I’m sure at least one person would say it’s OCD-like. Some would probably ponder a slight autistic quality about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows. I might have any of those things. I know my younger brother is autistic. He’s terrible when it comes to interactions but that kid is damn smart. Growing up, he took to video games like flies and dog crap. He’s five years and change younger than me but he schooled me in just about any video game we played once he got the hang of the mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got the hang of the mechanics involved in writing, I did the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not super social, and I’m all right with that. I can spend all weekend in front of my computer writing about stuff and discussing topics with people I never see and not have a care in the world. I could also spend al weekend on the beach with my camera taking photos without speaking a word to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet if I was to do some more research on the autism spectrum, I’d probably find some qualities that I happen to possess. I’m sure we all do in some form or another, but that doesn’t make us autistic. The spectrum has become really wide and we put more and more people in it because of vaccines we don’t know how to classify them any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure if a doctor told me I was slightly autistic, I wouldn’t care. I wouldn’t feel any different. It would explain my tendencies, but they’re mild enough that with enough effort from other angles, can be suppressed. Most days I just choose not to suppress them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take now, for example. Most days I’d be napping on the bus on my way to work because why not? Today, I decided to pack my laptop and continue writing. I didn’t get enough time this morning to write and I really enjoy it. A lot of people are sitting around me with their eyes closed, probably thinking about nothing. I’m sitting here bettering myself through words. I call that a big win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that this paragraph puts me at a thousand and four words for a rather simple topic, I want to close with this one thought: as a society we try to make everything black and white; I’m super guilty of this. We’re not black and white creatures, though. There are literally an infinite number of facets to each and every one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t put someone down because of their inability to do something particularly well. I’d bet you ten bucks in whatever currency you use that there’s a variant of that skill they’re really good at. In my case, I’d hate to speak publicly because I’m not that good at improvising. I could write a speech for someone in no time at all and master the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all incredibly different. Remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Office for Mac 2016 Preview</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/06/office-mac-2016/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/06/office-mac-2016</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I heard the news today that the long awaited Office for Mac update was close at hand and a preview was available, I was pretty excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloading the installer was painless. At 3GB, it’s hefty. On install, it takes more space than that, at 5.6GB, but not more than I would expect. Don’t let the installer fool you, though. Even if you only have just that amount of space, it won’t let you continue unless you’re at least 2x over that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installer took about five minutes to run, and I was in business. I can’t say I’ve been able to install Office on a Windows machine in five minutes, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-word&quot;&gt;Microsoft Word&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fired up Word first, as that’s a program I use a lot. I put Word 2011 and 2016 side by side to get a view of what it used to look like and what it looks like now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0519.07.511.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed APA paper templates from their respective start screens to use as demonstration documents. The templates aren’t the same (the 2016 templates are easier to search through) but you get the idea. Right form the get go, I’m already enjoying the new UI and its color scheme for 2016. I don’t appreciate the fact that 100% makes the document super small on my screen, but I suspect that’s the product of my screen resolution compared to its size. It’ll be another case where I zoom to 200% to get the screen usage I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0604.57.101.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0604.58.151.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the ribbon area is largely the same as it is in Word 2013, and as someone that uses Word 2013 a lot on a regular basis for work, this pleases me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ribbons1.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using word was as smooth as I would expect it to be. Even the default font that appears in Office for Windows looks good on a Mac. I mean really good. Sometimes I wonder what the heck is going on in Windows when it comes to fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.05.161.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microsoft-excel&quot;&gt;Microsoft Excel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started Excel, the first thing that jumped out at me was the new start window. It’s simple, and I like simple. Not much else to say there. Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all have this same opening screen to start you off on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.07.111.png?resize=860%2C558&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with spreadsheets is as typical of work as it gets in Excel and you either like doing them or you don’t. I use excel a lot at work, too, and 2016 feels very similar, which is quite nice. Everything renders just like I’d expect it to and everything is in roughly the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.08.201.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into the same level of detail as I did with Word. I don’t feel like there’s a need to repeat myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-powerpoint&quot;&gt;Microsoft PowerPoint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, the Keynote competitor. If you’re running a Mac on a daily basis, you’re familiar with Keynote, for sure. PowerPoint is the presentation god in a Windows-based business environment and I’m sure Microsoft wouldn’t mind sucking up a good user base in the OS X environment, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.12.481.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am saying it again with PowerPoint: the interface is very similar to its Windows counterpart. Now that I’ve said that for the third time, I’m sure you’re tired of hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-outlook&quot;&gt;Microsoft Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook is one of those email apps that if you need it, you absolutely can’t live without it. of these apps, this was the only one that needed time to prepare. I was running the earlier preview of Outlook and because of that it needed to upgrade its database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t really show you what I see in Outlook as I have work emails in it and I really don’t want to share that stuff. Here’s an image from Microsoft, instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Office-2016-for-Mac-5-1024x600.jpg?resize=882%2C517&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trying to clean up my email accounts in Outlook, it ended up freezing, which is definitely not good. I had the same issues with it before the whole 2016 suite preview was released so there’s still some work that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-onenote&quot;&gt;Microsoft OneNote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneNote is Microsoft’s answer to Evernote and the like. Unfortunately it’s not a good enough answer. While it doesn’t cost extra money to use Onenote, you can’t really get all the features you can with Evernote. Document conversion and searchable PDFs are a pipe dream for sure and even though things like that cost money with Evernote, it’s a small price and well worth the effort. OneNote syncs with OneDrive which is great if you enjoy OneDrive. Otherwise, you’re out of luck when it comes to storing your notebooks. I suppose Evernote stores your stuff in its cloud storage area, too, which isn’t much different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OneNote was also quite slow to start, too. If you’re an Evernote fan, I suggest you stick with it for now. There’s nothing in OneNote that would make we want to switch over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cloud&quot;&gt;The Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is in the cloud now, whether we like it or not. Each of these apps no longer require a serial number to activate, but instead just an active Office 365 subscription. I know what you’re thinking, you don’t like the idea of paying ‘membership fee’ or an ‘access fee’ to use your Office. What that sounds like to me is you not understanding how software EULAs work. Software is never really yours to begin with, you are just granted access to it. In this particular case, access is granted on a month-to-month basis, and is cheaper overall than paying outright. Office for Mac 2011 is $139. A single Office 365 license is $60 a year and comes with OneDrive storage out your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. This subscription model’s savings is realized even more when you find out you can use the Windows version, too, for no extra charge. Office 2013 costs upwards of $400 retail. Doesn’t sound like too bad of an offer, now does it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a student, you’re automatically given a free O365 license. Free office is awesome, and definitely not worth complaining over, even if it isn’t a one-time payment, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind you can purchase a subscription up front for a year, too, if you still really want to hold on to some semblance of the old days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ve realized that Microsoft’s choice to make the UIs as similar as possible was intentional. Cross-platform support is a real thing now at Microsoft and Office for Mac isn’t just some side project somewhere. OS X and iOS are real platforms in their eyes now and the updates reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure Microsoft appreciates your feedback. On the top right corner of every app is a smiley. Click on that bad boy and send them your feedback about the application you’re using. If you’re not a fan, tell them. If you are, tell them that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this major shift, I suspect Office for Mac will receive more regular updates that don’t take five years to cultivate. Microsoft’s Office for Mac team needed a huge culture shift and they received it under the transition from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella. Apple platforms aren’t a joke, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-03-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/06/girl-code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://appcamp4girls.com&quot;&gt;this site and program&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, a coding camp for girls. While I’m not a girl, I feel like I can still appreciate the idea of such a thing. If I had daughters, I’d want them to give this a shot. As much as we don’t want to admit it, girls aren’t all about ponies and princesses. It’s about creating better ponies and princesses through agile development practices. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now that I’ve made a joke about an actual program that does good work, &lt;a href=&quot;http://appcamp4girls.com&quot;&gt;App Camp for Girls&lt;/a&gt; is something I could get behind. We don’t have enough girls and women in STEM fields in the educational world nor in the professional world. Personally, I want to see more women as software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this would imply that the frat house environment that a lot of startups end up having because they’re 90% dude would have to end. You might be a startup, but you need to grow up. Don’t tell me that’s just how startups are… that’s deflection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t doubt there’s still an issue surrounding the equality of men and women in society. Look at gamer gate: a bunch of probably gross nerds sitting in their parent’s basements railing on women because they’re women and misogyny runs rampant in their lonely lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to see where &lt;a href=&quot;http://appcamp4girls.com&quot;&gt;App Camp for Girls&lt;/a&gt; expands to. They’re already rocking the North West with events in Vancouver, BC, Seattle WA, Portland, OR, and even Central NJ (which is definitely not in the NW).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night while I was browsing &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, I came across a rather exhaustive list of free things startups can use in one capacity or another. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/everything-about-startups-and-entrepreneurship/300-awesome-free-things-e07b3cd5fd5b&quot;&gt;300 Awesome Free Things&lt;/a&gt; covers everything and ended up become its own website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://freebie.supply&quot;&gt;Freebie.Supply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freebie.Supply covered Business, Marketing, Design/Code, Productivity, and Learning tools that are essentially 100% free. It’s really quite a great resource to poke through and see what you can take advantage of right now, without having to put out a single penny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I have for right now. A busy day is ahead of me. Keep up the good fight and continue working on whatever you’re doing to improve your quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Recovering From Failure, Part 2</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/04/failure-part-2/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/04/failure-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/failure&quot; title=&quot;Recovering from Failure&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I spent a few minutes spilling my guts about a recent failure. It felt good to get it out there and the support and helpful words I received made it feel less painful. Failing sucks and it’s hard to swallow the truth that you’ll fail at something you think you’re good at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve had a little bit of time to look back on it, I see it in a more neutral light. While I’m certainly still bummed out, it’s not affecting me like it did yesterday and the day before. Truth be told, I’m just one of many. My story isn’t unique or groundbreaking. Even the smartest of people fail at things from time to time. It’s what they do afterwards that makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This failure event was timed perfectly. After listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do&quot;&gt;John Saddington&lt;/a&gt;’s first podcast show thing called &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.desk.pm/ati-001/&quot;&gt;Ask The Indie&lt;/a&gt;, it got me thinking. What am I doing to continually enrich myself, not just in my regular studies but in my career? I want to be in a better position in five years, a year, even six months from now, doing more of what I enjoy: making things that people see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Aside: part of the reason why I chose a self-hosted option for running this site, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I could used a hosted platform and I would probably enjoy it, but that’s not what I’m about.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a decision last Friday that every weekday, I would spend one hour doing something that enriched my technical knowledge bucket in my head and can be used to further my career (when combined with other essential pieces). This is where the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://trueability.com&quot;&gt;TrueAbility&lt;/a&gt; comes into play. I’ve known about them for some time but always looked at them like they were just a performance/technical assessment type site for job hunters. While that’s certainly true, there’s more to their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things they offer are a lot of “101” courses on technical matters, typically surrounding development, Linux, WordPress, and other SysAdmin-y type things. They’re free to use and if you’re looking for a job, they have listings, too. Take one of their performance tests with questions chosen by the employer and they’ll send your results straight to them and likely put you on a shortlist compared to taking the traditional route of submitting a resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy their platform and how quickly one can get started. The catch is everything is done via the command line so get comfortable with SSH/Putty, Linux, and other non-Windows development processes. Did I mention the tests are timed? I didn’t? Oh, well they’re timed. Most are 60-90 minutes in length. If you’re taking a performance assessment created by a potential employer, it would behoove you to not get hung up on one thing you can’t figure out. If you spend all your time on one problem and never move on to the rest, it’ll bring your score down. Each question is not all or nothing in most cases so come back to it and complete some of the other tasks, instead. It’ll make a big difference, I promise. Getting an 80% is much better than getting a 20% because you spent all your time on the first of five tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of all this, the real trick is to never give up and to never stop pushing forward. The proverbial horse will always be there to get back up on, that apple cart isn’t going to leave without you, and take advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/settling&quot;&gt;your support system&lt;/a&gt; if you have one. It’ll help immensely. &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support&quot; title=&quot;My Support&quot;&gt;It’s helping me&lt;/a&gt;, quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I received contact for an interview with another company, yesterday, so that also did quite a bit to boost my spirits. In my case, there’ll be all “no” responses until I get a yes. That’s just how it is.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Recovering from Failure</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/03/failure</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I failed. I failed pretty hard. It hurt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may well know, the search for a new job in San Francisco is on. A recent application I placed with a company I very well respect and admire got a response. They sent me a performance assessment to run through. I thought this would be an amazing time to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there was no shining to be had. I bombed it spectacularly. By the end of the hour, I likely received the worst possible score the test is capable of, short of not taking it at all. What’s worse, I went into it thinking I would be able to master it since it’s in my field. It’s stuff I know how to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience and views towards my experience came into question quite thoroughly. I’m not completely over it, yet, as the impact was greater than most rejections because of the company in question. I had my heart set on working for an awesome company on an awesome product that I really enjoyed, myself. Now that likely won’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife tells me it will be alright, and while it’s hard to agree with that right now, she’s right. There’s another test waiting for me that I haven’t started yet. I’m not sure if I’ll actually take it. I don’t know if I want to go through what I went through yesterday, one more time. Sure there’s a chance I can ace it, but that still doesn’t really show I’m qualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to mull this over, today, and see how I feel. If I decide to take it, I’ll do it tonight. Whether I pass or fail, it’ll make a good story to write about, tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now’s the time to recover from this failure. It still stings, but I can still build back up that foundation I’m standing on and keep the hunt going. It’s not something I’ll forget easily, but it’s a fact of life. Part of turning pro is accepting failures and moving on from them as they happen. Sometimes shit really does happen and there’s nothing you can do about it. In my case, more education and experience could possibly have fixed my situation, but that’s not a for sure notion.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Weekend Off</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/02/the-weekend-off</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I took the weekend off from blogging. It’s the first time in a while that I haven’t posted something, even just a link. I wanted to take time and focus on myself and personal enrichment. Because I’m looking for a new job since we’re moving, it was fitting that I spend most of my time in that category, including education. I spent all weekend working on my CCNA and sprucing up my Linux deployment skills. It’s nothing too exciting, but I did learn that NodeJS is a little memory leaker, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.jlyman.net&quot;&gt;dev blog&lt;/a&gt; running Ghost, just for kicks, and let it sit. It gets zero traffic, but NodeJS keeps using more memory. I feel it’s one of those things that’ll eventually use as much as it can and deal with the repercussions later. I am not thrilled. I’ll keep an eye on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I’m back on the horse for the week ahead. Next weekend will likely yield the same set of tasks, but I might sneak in a post or two.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be a groundbreaking moment in history unless an opposing political party starting whining and groaning and stomping their feet until they get their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;US Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) today filed legislation to overturn the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/fcc-overturns-state-laws-that-protect-isps-from-local-competition/&quot;&gt;municipal broadband decision&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Communications Commission made earlier in the day.Let’s keep in mind this isn’t net neutrality overall, just the ruling the FCC made regarding a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/fcc-overturns-state-laws-that-protect-isps-from-local-competition/&quot;&gt;municipality’s ability to expand&lt;/a&gt; outside their designated territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone didn’t contact, I’d be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/26/ghq</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/technology/google-plans-new-headquarters-and-a-city-fears-being-overrun.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This week,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More information about Google Inc.&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, the search giant, is expected to propose new headquarters — a series of canopylike buildings from Heatherwick Studio, a London design firm known for works like the fiery caldron at the 2012 Olympics, and Bjarke Ingels, a Danish architect known for his innovative designs.Sweet, that sounds like a great idea! They already have a billion something buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Google owns or leases about 7.3 million square feet of office space in Mountain View — roughly equivalent to three Empire State Buildings. That includes most of the property around its headquarters on the north side of the city near Highway 101, which cuts the length of the valley, according to Transwestern, a commercial real estate brokerage.That’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That success has brought Mountain View loads of tax dollars and a 3.3 percent unemployment rate, as well as skyrocketing home prices and intolerable gridlock. Good and bad, tech is responsible for most of it: Google is Mountain View’s biggest taxpayer, and technology companies account for 27 percent of the jobs in the Silicon Valley region, compared with 7 percent in California and about 5 percent nationally, according to Moody’s Analytics.And that’s a lot, too…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One argument was that it would be dangerous to burrowing owls that live underground in adjacent Shoreline Park. Another was that if people moved there, they would soon want more schools and other expensive services. Others feared that new housing could create a Google voting bloc.Wait… what? Owls? Voters? Do people have so much free time in Mountain View that they fret about voting? Nobody frets about voting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This last election we had maybe 12,000 voters,” said Jac Siegel, a city councilman who left office this year and is not related to Leonard Siegel. “If you brought 5,000 people in and they all work for Google and they said, ‘We want you to vote for this candidate,’ they can own the town.”I like ending with a good chuckle and math fails. 17000/5000 &amp;lt; 51%. In case you weren’t following along. Then there’s the corporate political heavy-handing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary last weekend and it also roughly marked the point where we started dating three and a half years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s been my best support system throughout all of this. I’d go anywhere for her—and in fact I &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/scared-to-act&quot;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/be-ready&quot;&gt;am&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t want for what life holds in store for us in the next several years as we make our way to California and spend the better part of a decade there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be a grand new adventure for the both of us, likely more so for me as I’ve never lived outside the state of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Kaysze, you’re the best wife a man could ever ask for &lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the 55th day of the year, and I’ve made it to 100. I’m not quite sure what the rest of the year holds. As I sit here with my coffee  like I do most mornings, I’m thinking about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;first real stent&lt;/a&gt; at blogging, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/smart&quot;&gt;first goals I set&lt;/a&gt; for myself, and when &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/for-february&quot;&gt;I changed up those goals&lt;/a&gt; shortly after because I ended up blowing through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March is coming around soon, so it’ll be time to make slight adjustments, as always. I’m excited for the next 100 posts. Let’s see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tomorrow</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;via Pressfield:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sure sign of an amateur is he has a million plans and they all start tomorrow.What plans start today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guilty of this. The idea of ‘why do today what you can put off until tomorrow.’ It’s a terrible way to think and it leads to more procrastination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My struggle with this rears its ugly head even more now as I’m simultaneously going to school, doing job training, and searching for a new job in a place I’ve never really been to (outside of a few hours). I definitely don’t have the advantage of being local. I also don’t have the advantage of being a brain child or software development prodigy so in an area where not only tech jobs are a dime a dozen, but people to fill them are a nickel a dozen, my work is cut out for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying it’s impossible: leads are starting to trickle in. I’m saying it’s an uphill battle and because I still have time, it’s easy for me to say I’ll work on it tomorrow, or this weekend. Turns out I don’t have that much time. A couple months and change isn’t much time and I have a hard deadline to meet. I have a backup plan but even that’s not a for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much riding on this, it’s not something I can hold off doing. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three Hobbies</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Find three hobbies you love: one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, and one to be creative.Bonus points if you have one über-hobby that gets you all three. In my case, photography is that hobby. I’m not quite covered on #1 and #2, but  it’ll take time. No hobby is a money printer or ass kicker overnight (unless you print money while standing on one leg holding a medicine ball and painting at the same time). &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Self-Comparison</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The amateur is a narcissist. He views the world hierarchically. He continuously rates himself in relation to others, becoming self-inflated if his fortunes rise, and desperately anxious if his star should fall.How often do you rate yourself compared to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do it. It’s hard not to. You see where you’re at in life and look at your friends and maybe they’re ahead of you. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel like crap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel this way because I’ve, yet again, caught myself overflowing with envy and want. While not necessarily bad, when misguided, it can lead to poor relationships or no relationships at all. It’s impossible to have genuine contact with someone you wish you were more like. You can’t just be their friend, colleague, etc., without thinking about how much better they are than you at X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key isn’t to think that you want to be like them. The key is to want to do the cool things they do, too. Use that relationship to your advantage! Have them mentor you. Teach you. Make use of the personal contact you have and reach that level you were so envious about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Always Find Time</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/23/always-find-time</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@drevets/sit-down-shut-up-write-don-t-stop-d3f671d4a41b&quot;&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; this evening about finding time to write, every day, no matter what:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to tell him to stop being an amateur and just nut up and write every single day, even when he didn’t feel like it, especially when he didn’t feel like it. I wanted to tell him that inspiration is a joke and is about as meaningful as a bartender’s smile. But I didn’t tell him that, mostly because I’m a coward.It doesn’t take rocket science or hours of planning to come up with something to talk about. People say they don’t have anything good to say… wait what? Everyone has good things to say otherwise they wouldn’t ever talk. Instead of rambling that out loud where people won’t likely ever remember it, put it on paper, or put it online in a blog on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://squarespace.com&quot;&gt;SquareSpace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogger.com&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wix.com&quot;&gt;Wix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sbvtle.com&quot;&gt;Subtle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://silvrback.com&quot;&gt;Silvrback&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewritesource.com/writing_topics/&quot;&gt;countless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://writingprompts.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailyteachingtools.com/journal-writing-prompts.html&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://talk.desk.pm&quot;&gt;great places&lt;/a&gt; to discuss your new flow of creative juices. Find an app on the iTunes, Android or Windows App Stores and note down your thoughts or write out a whole piece to publish later. Find something or someone interesting on the street and write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you go into town (or your largest urban center), travel in a circle around a block for five minutes, stop, look behind you and that’s your next topic. &lt;em&gt;Seriously&lt;/em&gt;. There’s so much to talk about and so much to say. We’ve sucked ourselves into a bitch life of social media and not communicating our thoughts and feelings anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re done, read a book. No… read three. Hell… read five. Listening counts, too, so long as you do nothing but listen and imagine yourself with the character(s) in the story. Find a genre of book you wouldn’t normally read or listen to and try it out. What stood out to you about that book and that genre? There’s another topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came up with that stuff in the amount of time it took me to type it. I didn’t rehearse it. Hell, I didn’t rehearse or plan any of this. I literally just wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be a pansy. Sit down and write something.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Alone</title>

   <updated>2015-02-23T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/23/alone</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EMXBDMA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00EMXBDMA&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=EJPMID7W3G3C7TOR&quot;&gt;The Martian by Andy Weir&lt;/a&gt; lately, and while not a long book, it’s deep. The story follows Mark Watney, one of the first people to step foot on Mars. He also might be one of the first to die on Mars, too…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on this story, I can’t help but wonder what it would be like to be alone on Mars, or anywhere for that matter, for an extended period of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it for a second:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your only friend is dirty mars dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, maybe there is something to do, something to keep your mind occupied. Maybe there’s something to be had out of nothing or very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Watney in The Martian, at times we find ourselves in similar situations, in less than ideal circumstances. Sometimes, we’re down to pretty much nothing (read: ramen). It can feel like all hope is lost and there’s no point in continuing to go on. No one is coming to save you and no one is even noticing you’re in a void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/quitting&quot;&gt;talked about having a good support system&lt;/a&gt; before, and I’ll mentioned it again. Having good friends and family, even if only a few, around you to keep pushing when it doesn’t seem like there’s a reason is critical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine where we’d all be if nobody supported each other and we were left to fend for ourselves. No camaraderie, no friendship, no push to do better (or just do). Life would be utterly dismal and meaningless. We give meaning to live and meaning to those living life by supporting one another, even it’ll be a long time before help arrives. Sometimes one needs to duct tape life’s pieces back together to keep them in place in the short term. No one said it had to be permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Like most media workers, Matthew Lazin-Ryder, a Vancouver-based producer with CBC Radio, spends a fair amount of time on Twitter. When he  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lazin_ryder&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;, his messages are seen by some percentage of his 3,470 followers. They retweet, favorite, write pithy replies. And then, a week later, his tweets disappear.It’s interesting to see that this is actually a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Settling for Second&#8230; or Third&#8230; or Fourth Best</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/settling/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Settling for a ‘meh’ lifestyle leads to nothing more than ‘meh’ everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was in deadly earnest and committed 100% to making my life as an over-the-road trucker. What I was really doing was running away…It’s easy to get into a rut and stick to a routine that involves mediocrity. Sometimes it’s easy. Easy work can also pay well, too. In Pressfield’s case, driving a truck and traveling around the country. Sure that sounds cool, but is that what turning pro means? For some, sure. Some people genuinely enjoy truck driving and that’s their career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your world, what are you doing to contribute to your purpose? What is it that you want to do with your life? Is what you’re doing now contributing to that? Unless it’s hobby related, that answer should be yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=BNM2PMM3XHDP636W&quot;&gt;Pressfield&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We pursue callings that take us nowhere and permit ourselves to be controlled by compulsions that we cannot understand (or are not aware of) and whose outcomes serve only to keep us caged, unconscious and going nowhere.Are you addicted to living a ‘meh’ life? While such things are inherently less dangerous than an addition to a hard drug, addicts all have similar descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…the lies, the evasions, the transparent self-justifications and self-exonerations. But the addict himself is often a colorful and fascinating person.There’s a layer of crap on top of a great wealth of awesomeness. Even with living life, it’s easy to become addicted to the security blanket or comfort zone one builds around themselves. It’s easy to stay within those bounds and do nothing more than what’s necessary to keep that wall up. Distractions are made and deviations happen often so as to keep the momentum of boring going and to keep the unknown from catching up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The amateur is an egotist. He takes the material of his personal pain and uses it to draw attention to himself. He creates a “life,” a “character,” a “personality.”Also known as: “&lt;em&gt;woe is me.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for me to tell you to stand up and face the fear of the unknown and put down the metaphoric needle of habitual boringness. In reality it’s not. Without confidence to try something new or finally take that first step to becoming pro at life or at what you want to do, fear, self-doubt, and self-sabotage will take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be done about that? A support system is a great start. If you’ve never climbed a mountain before, doing it alone isn’t a good idea. If you’ve never stepped out into the unknown before, having someone or a group of people to help you wherever they can makes it easier. Have friends hold you accountable. Have your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend, sister, brother or other relative check in on you every day and talk about how it’s all going. However this support system helps, never ignore it and never push back when you hate what it has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Giving Up is Easy</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/quitting/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/quitting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The easiest way out of a difficult situation in life is to give up or pull the pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=BNM2PMM3XHDP636W&quot;&gt;Pressfield&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The term “pulling the pin” comes from the old days of riding the rails. To uncouple one car from another, the train crew pulled a heavy steel pin out of the coupling mechanism.When someone pulls the pin in a metaphorical sense, they’re giving up, they’re quitting. I’ve been in situations where I wanted to give up so bad. There were times that I did, too! Hell, I’ve given up a lot in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I gave up, it was because I made a made decision in the first place. Sometimes, it was because I didn’t give a rat’s ass, and sometimes, I was bailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is immune to giving up because it’s easier. Looking back on things I gave up on, if I stuck with them, I could be in a different place than I am today. Instead, I have to live with my choices, and those choices ultimately gave me the great things I have today… with a bunch of additional hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can speculate that I might not have the job I have today, I might not have the wife I have today, and I might not be living where I am today. Who really knows? If I hadn’t given up high school, I could have gone to a good college and had a degree in something I enjoy several years ago. Looking at my age, I would also likely have a master’s degree, all before I turned 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled the pin and paid the consequences for it. I failed out of high school and had to start over in order to graduate. I had to work jobs that didn’t require much education in order to make a living. I led a shadow life not doing what I really wanted to do because I fucked up. Even during this shadow period, I never pulled the pin, and it’s paying off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I go back and do it differently? Hell yeah I would, so long as I can pick and choose what happens. Unfortunately, that’s not how life works, so without that control, I absolutely wouldn’t go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you think about pilling the pin or giving up, think about what’ll happen next. Think about more than just your feelings at that moment. Stop being selfish. I was selfish and only cared about my laziness. I cared only about how easy the easy way out was. Life isn’t easy. To think it is, is amateurish in nature and a guaranteed way to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen what it’s like to not give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a fucking quitter. Fuck pulling pins.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Putting In the Effort to Become a Professional Life Liver</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/professional-life-liver/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/professional-life-liver</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What do you think about when I say the words “you’re an amateur at living life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=YQM2YDP3UUCJ7UF6&quot;&gt;Pressfield&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we hate our lives and ourselves, two models present themselves as modes of salvation.The first is the therapeutic model. In the therapeutic model, we are told (or we tell ourselves ) that we are “sick.” What ails us is a “ &lt;strong&gt;condition&lt;/strong&gt; ” or a “ &lt;strong&gt;disease&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second way is the moralistic model. The moralistic model is about good and evil. The reason we are unhappy, we are told (or tell ourselves) is that we have done something “ &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.” We have committed a “crime” or a “sin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve established two potential outcomes for how we’ll treat ourselves if we’re not where we want to be in life or aren’t good at something we wish we were good at. That sound like a pretty noob way of thinking. The ultimate goal should be not to knock down but to hack and slash the crap away. In turn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We find our will and our voice and we find our self-respect. We become who we always were but had, until then, been afraid to embrace and to live out.That’s the end goal but it won’t happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to come to terms with the idea that I had ambition. I felt guilty about it. Who was I to aspire to “rise above” my brothers and sisters or to aim to be “better” than anybody else?The words of a quitter… are you a quitter? I sure as shit am not. There are days when I feel like I should just give up but I never do because that’s me looking for an easy way out and not finding one. There’s never an easy way out of life. This includes suicide. That’s not an easy way out. There’s nothing easy about leaving your friends, family, and the world behind forever. There’s no such thing as a random act of suicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest driver of turning pro is ambition. Without it, failure is imminent. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fake SSL: Another Reason to Own a Mac</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/fake-ssl/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/fake-ssl</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m almost positive I’ll receive flack for this from people who think I’m talking out my ass, and that’s fine. Recently, it has come to light that certain model Lenovo laptops were shipping with what most would chalk up to nothing more than adware, a.k.a Superfish. For a few months at the end of 2014, consumer grade Lenovo laptops received this software that hijacks web browsing sessions ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/a&gt; included) and injecting them with ads it feels you’ll appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that description, about every adware out there is on the same level, and probably is viewed all the same by Lenovo. Curious enough, this software wasn’t ever present on any business-class laptop or desktop like the ThinkPad or X1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of attack is what’s referred to as a MITM or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&quot;&gt;Man-in-the-Middle&lt;/a&gt; attack. It sits quietly between you and whatever your destination is on the web and picks out and replaces bits as it sees fit. In this case, these bits were ads. Typically this isn’t easily done, if at all, with secured traffic (identified with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; in the address) but Superfish took it one step further, and packaged their adware with an additional root certificate that masquerades as being owned by whichever secure site you visit. A typical user probably wouldn’t ever notice this as their browser would show the site is secure and the certificate is for said site. A few seconds of clicking around would reveal that certificate isn’t actually owned by the site (or company) being visited, exposing the catastrophic problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this even worse is Lenovo claims they though their users would &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-honestly-thought-youd-enjoy-that-superfish-https-spyware/&quot;&gt;enjoy it&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t have much else to say surrounding that. It seems pretty self-explanatory that Lenovo’s consumer division is an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more technically inclined people would catch on to this right away and make the necessary changes to pull the root CA and be on their merry way. Others would wipe their system and install Windows fresh from the get-go without any of the bloatware or extra crap to this day still ships on some consumer PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; : If you want a retail machine that doesn’t ship with shit, buy a business desktop or laptop. You’ll have a much better time._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in knowing more about wiping your PC the easy way or cleaning it up without all the hassle, Paul Thurrott has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thurrott.com/tag/clean-pc&quot;&gt;great articles on his site&lt;/a&gt; for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re more adventurous, you could wipe the root CA away yourself with some help from &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-to-remove-the-superfish-malware-what-lenovo-doesnt-tell-you/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Ars Technica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Defender has new functionality to clean out this adware, as highlighted by Microsoft, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/windows-defender-now-removes-superfish-malware-if-youre-lucky/&quot;&gt;running it might also solve your problems&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re one of the few users running one of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s talk about my original statement in the title of this post. This wouldn’t have ever happened on a Mac. I know I say crap like that all the time, and while it’s true, I understand how it can sound douchey. Too bad I don’t care. One of the many reasons I bought a mac was for security. I know that computers are inherently safer if people aren’t attacking them but with the market share in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/07/mac-achieves-highest-u-s-pc-market-share-ever-in-q3-2014-according-to-idc/&quot;&gt;double digits&lt;/a&gt; now, an attacker could still stand to gain a bit from Mac users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows PCs have been plagued with pre-loaded crap for years. Back in the mid-2000s, they came with a literal boat load of freeware, shareware, trial software, and other adrific crap no one wanted. It was how the PCs became so cheap after a time. Today, they’re still cheap, and like the above scenario, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtogeek.com/174587/refreshing-your-pc-wont-help-why-bloatware-is-still-a-problem-on-windows-8/&quot;&gt;still holding crap nobody wants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something Apple does will is keep a tight grip on the shipping product. There aren’t companies stuffing their crap into Apple systems of any kind so Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtogeek.com/163303/how-computer-manufacturers-are-paid-to-make-your-laptop-worse/&quot;&gt;can make an additional few dollars and random companies can do the same&lt;/a&gt;. The out-of-the-box experience has always been a big deal for Apple and while us Mac users might be paying a premium, we’re also being spared from massive security holes and the like created by third parties and purposely installed by our computer manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to try and deny fake SSL certificates can’t appear on a Mac. It’s possible, for sure. The key here is Apple doesn’t ship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft claims to be doing some good work in this area with their Signature Edition PCs you’ll probably only find in Microsoft Stores. It’s a bit cheesy but their site describes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoftstore.com/store?SiteID=msusa&amp;amp;Locale=en_US&amp;amp;Action=ContentTheme&amp;amp;pbPage=MicrosoftSignature&amp;amp;ThemeID=33363200&quot;&gt;how much faster your new Windows PC can be&lt;/a&gt; if you bought it from Microsoft instead of that cheap ass PC OEM. You know it’s a sad day when Microsoft is taking advantage of the situations their own OEMs have created (the same ones that buy Windows OEM licenses from them) in order to make some extra cash. It’s pretty much a double-dip on Microsoft’s part and they’re enjoying it, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I write this on my Mac, let’s not forget not every manufacturer does this. Be sure they’re being watched even closer now by security experts who are waiting for the day the next batch of PCs comes out with vulnerability-laden crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you’re interested: Superfish has gone silent. I guess they won’t be needing those new iOS developers they’re hiring for, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do or Die</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/do-or-die/"/>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/21/do-or-die</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;amp;linkId=BNM2PMM3XHDP636W&quot;&gt;Pressfield&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t talk to anybody during my year of turning pro. I didn’t hang out. I just worked. I had a book in mind and I had decided I would finish it or kill myself. I could not run away again, or let people down again, or let myself down again. This was it, &lt;strong&gt;do or die&lt;/strong&gt;.While maybe a tad extreme, it has an extremely powerful point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At what point do we nut up or shut up? Shit or get off the pot? If we can’t take the heat, we get out of the kitchen. All these metaphors mean the same thing, as you see just above in deliciously bold characters:  &lt;strong&gt;do or die&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in a scenario where I have to think about the fact that if I don’t do something, a metric ton of consequences will follow, I think about one thing: why the hell am I pondering not doing and instead considering dying? I’m not literally dying in these situations, but I might as well be killing my goals and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve pondered a lot about the idea that choosing to not do something equates to taking two steps back and every positive move is just one step forward. It’s easy to get lost in the weeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, even doing doesn’t pan out. Spending all that time on that thing yielded zero other things. What was the point? Sticking to it and giving 100% is the point. That’s how you become a pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are things I think about. Why am I in the job I’m in? Because it’s the next step. Why does it suck? Because I decided it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pondering my career more and more as I approach May. If you haven’t been following along a lot or ever, really, I’m moving out of state in May for the foreseeable future. At least seven to ten years of my life will be in another state, doing other things. It’s up to me to make those things as kickass and valuable as possible. I either do, or I die.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/20/internetaholics-anonymous</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Social media is all around us at this point. It’s hard to avoid a conversation or an interaction with someone without it involving some sort of social media communication. One could argue that it’s the more current version of email, text messaging, and letter writing of days, decades, and centuries past, sure. I’m not entirely sure where I stand on it. I enjoy checking things out on Facebook, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/jlymanphoto&quot;&gt;post my photography&lt;/a&gt; to Instagram, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/theejl&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;… but I enjoy a good face-to-face conversation, too… &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Desk 1.2</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am super stoke to see Desk reach version 1.2. I’m also stoked to see a bunch of stuff fixed or improved that I was itching for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a user of desk for the last month and change, and I’m still really enjoying the app. It’s simple and it practically forces me to think about writing first. A couple of the biggest changes that I was looking forward to were the ability to adjust view amount of screen real estate being used for text (and the fact that it’s adjustable), and the spacing between paragraphs has been fixed. The issue surrounding odd spacing showing up in the editor when text was stylized seems to be fixed, too, which is a nice plus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a Desk user, go download it now. It’s $30 on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk-write-more/id915839505?mt=12&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt; and well worth the price!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I picked up The Martian by way of a recommendation a friend gave me. I’ve seen it on the shelf for a minute now and I’m pretty excited to start listening to it. Most books I don’t read (a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jlyman.net/turning-pro&quot;&gt;recent purchase&lt;/a&gt; being an exception) but instead listen to via Audible. If you’re not an Audible user, give them a shot. Like everything else I recommend, I am an Audible user and greatly enjoy their service. If you want a listen along with me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.jlyman.net/audibleft30&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for a free trial and get a &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; free books to keep, even if you hate the service. I’ll be updating occasionally, like a digital book club of sorts, as I progress through the book. I’m excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt; Turns out my info was a bit off. Instead of a free audiobook, you get  &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; free audiobooks. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I picked up a new book yesterday morning by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Turning-Pro-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B0087TUM54&quot;&gt;Steven Pressfield called Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, I downloaded it to my iPad with the Amazon Kindle app (does anyone actually “pick up” books anymore?). I’m quite intrigued so far with what the author has to say. He sounds like he’s seen some stuff and went through a lot of trials in life before finding the path that leads to success and meaningful contribution to life. There’s no magic key, no one-step process to instant awesomeness. It takes work. As I keep reading, I’ll share some thoughts that I have. So far, I’m impressed with seeing from where Pressfield has come and how much effort he put into turning himself around and doing more than the menial. He was even a truck driver at one point. And he lived in a cabin in the woods. That’s pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Creativity is an act of defiance.” – Twyla Tharp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity is an act of expression using unique methods to convey your thoughts and ideas. We have many forms of creative expression available to us in these times, however it didn’t used to be that way. Creative expression was limited and people who stepped outside the box create by the government or the church were doomed to punishment or worse. Don’t ever take for granted the amount of opportunity you have to share your voice, however small you think it may be. Should the day ever come where we look back on ourselves and witness the changes that happened right under our noses and we kept our thoughts and our voices to ourselves, we will be filled with deep regret and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>CrashPlan</title>

   <updated>2015-02-17T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/17/crashplan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to talk for a minute about a particular service I really enjoy and have been using since 2012. I also want to be very clear that I’m not being paid to write this. I only endorse products and services I actually use. As of this writing I do not gain a percentage of any sales made in relation to this article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have that out of the way, let’s talk about backing up your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important. Super important, in fact. Hard drives die all the time, and SSDs die, too; don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I back up my computer all the time to two locations: local and offsite. The former is in the form of a Time Machine I set up using an external HDD (3TB, USB 2.0). The latter is an offsite backup solution that send folders I choose to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cloud backup service is called CrashPlan. You might have heard of it, and if you have, that’s great. If you’re already a user, that’s even better. There are many cloud backup plans out there but this one I find is the best and the overall experience is outstanding, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting out, you get a free month to give it a shot. Signing up at CrashPlan.com requires zero payment, and if your free trial ends, you’re not on the hook for more months. The way the service keeps your membership up to date is through a serial number. You can purchase one or more licenses on the site, and plug them into computers where CrashPlan is installed. You don’t actually have to punch in your account information all the time in the CrashPlan app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backups occur in the background, out of sight. If you’re busy using your computer, it’ll backup at a slower and quieter pace. When you’re machine is idle, it’ll speed up, and spend more time working on your files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that sets CrashPlan apart is the fact that it can be used to backup your files to a local disk as well as another system on or offsite for free. The only thing you pay for is cloud. All files are encrypted before transmission and remain so when they land in the cloud. Only you can see the contents of a file and only your account and decrypt them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a smartphone and access your files anywhere. Use another computer and download them from their Web site. Backup up to ten computers in your household for as low as $8.96 a month or get started with just a single computer for as low as $3.96 a month. Obviously the more machines your have and the farther ahead you pre-pay, the better your deal will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give CrashPlan a shot. I love them. They’ve been running on my system for almost three years now and I haven’t had a single complaint. It’s a backup service I can set and forget and they’ve done a great job of staying out of the way while making sure the files I find most important are backed up on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Invisible Girlfriend</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/16/invisible-girlfriend/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/16/invisible-girlfriend</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I caught an article this morning from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a32668/invisible-girlfriend-experiment/&quot;&gt;Esquire&lt;/a&gt; talking about the writer’s experiences with &lt;a href=&quot;http://invisiblegirlfriend.com&quot;&gt;InvisibleGirlfriend.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No matter what I asked, Zoe always had a logical response. If she didn’t, she expertly skirted the question. Sometimes her texts were ominous, sometimes oddly detailed. She was always in a good mood. She didn’t mind if I ignored her for hours, though she always responded to me within minutes. She never texted first. If I didn’t initiate that day’s conversation, we simply didn’t talk.LOL… &lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png&quot; alt=&quot;:(&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept reading the article and came to an odd conclusion: there really is something out there for everyone. At the same time, I became a little sad. The somethings out there for “everyone” include people behind a wall getting paid per text to have small talk with someone. Ten bucks says Zoe, the woman the author highlights in the article, looks nothing like her picture.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>After 40 Days of Writing</title>

   <updated>2015-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/16/40-days</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been roughly 40 days since I started writing on a continual basis. Some days have been more productive than others. There are days when all I manage to come up with are posts about other things going on in the world. I have enjoyed being able to just sit down and discuss what’s on my mind. When I sit down and talk about something that’s on my mind I end up writing a boat load of words. These &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; are good examples. The first covered &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill&quot;&gt;project management buzzwords&lt;/a&gt; and the second covers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades&quot;&gt;god-awful movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one thing I do more now than I ever did before. I think about what I want to talk about tomorrow. When something appears in my head I determine if it is good fodder for my blog. I don’t have a real direction for my blog just yet. This will change with time. For now I focus on writing and discussing topics I find important. I know someone out there will find them to be interesting. Perhaps they’ll share what they read with their friends. I won’t ever know if they don’t like them because I don’t use post comments. I decided comments were useless. They don’t contribute to my blogging experience in the least bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more cool thing has happened. I didn’t use a comma in this whole post.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>50 Shades of Wasted Time</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/15/50-shades/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/15/50-shades</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried a lot of different titles for this post, starting the moment I left the theater last night. This one seems to fit the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heads up: if you haven’t read the books, my recounting the movie might spoil something for you. There’s nothing in the movie that wasn’t in the book so don’t freak out. Keep your pants on. No one needs to see that. Also, I’ll probably end up ranting by the end of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife is a fan of the books, and I don’t blame her. She likes to read that sort of thing, just like millions of other women. I don’t fault her for that, and I never will. It became an adult fiction sensation of sorts and eventually a movie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never read the books, and if I had a plan to read them before, I certainly don’t now. I saw the movie last night on Valentine’s Day because my wife thought it would be romantic and fun. Me being the cynic I am, scoffed at the idea but since I like to support my wife in her decisions and ideas, I opted to go without making too much of a fuss—I did make a lot of jokes about ‘butt stuff’ on our way to the theater, though, because I can be rather immature at times and jokes about ‘butt stuff’ is funny in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line to get into the theater was long, but not Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings long. It was composed of two groups of people: women with their women friends who are excited to see Jamie Dornan naked doing sexy things, and couples where the woman likely brought the man so she could see Jamie Dornan naked doing sexy things in hopes he’ll think said sexy things are worth attempting back at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first exposure to the actual story of Christian Grey beyond anecdotes my wife shared with me in the last couple of years while she read the books. I frankly didn’t remember anything about him other than that he liked butt stuff and was an asshole. To have a movie surrounding that? Whew, I’m excited…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dakota Johnson’s character, Anastasia Steele turned out exactly how I thought she would. Nothing fits the whole storyline of an inexperienced woman meeting a man who knows all sorts of kinky moves like a woman who’s never been with a man, period. Might as well go all the way, I guess. Johnson and Dornan are good looking people and fit the roles well up to that point. Johnson’s character is too awkward to not be noticed in the way that fingernails can’t be ignored on a chalkboard, and Dornan sucks at being an American. Plus, anyone with the last name of Steele, according to every other romance novel in existence should be better prepared for just about anything. Did anyone notice the dynamic between the names Grey and Steele? Let that sink in for a minute. Yes. The author lacks that much creativity. Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film opens up exactly like you would expect. A 20-something girl just trying to get by, doing that whole homebody thing with not much time for men as she just tries to get by in school and at her ‘meh’ job at a place in which she has no interest. The all of a sudden a magnificent piece of chiseled man enters her life because why the hell not. Add a dash of awkward, another cup of awkward, and a pinch of bad writing, and you have the opening scenes of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move throughout the movie, I notice particulars about Seattle that the filmmakers would hope no one would notice. First, North Seattle is not 90 miles away from Seattle and it’s definitely not called Portland. Yes. They think that little of you. The scene involving Ana entering the freeway on her journey to Seattle to interview Grey was shot ten miles north of Seattle. Conveniently it was the exact same place where I saw this movie—the theater was in the background. Somehow they figured out how to bend space-time since 90 miles opened up between what us Seattle people call Northgate and downtown Seattle. While I’m enjoying pointing out how wrong that scene was, let me point out: there is a hell of a lot more than 90 miles between Portland and Seattle. Let’s try 170, depending on where you’re coming and going. Way to go, guys. You didn’t even try. A lot of the other scenes in the movie are in real locations, and points to whomever did the areal footage while we had our Seahawks flag up on the Space Needle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a man, this movie frustrated me quite a bit, not because there was a better looking man on the screen doing weird shit with a girl who’s never had sex in her life, but because he’s a pompous asshole. I wanted to title this post “50 Shades of Pompus Asshole” but that was too narrow. The story basically boiled down to a guy with mommy issues who was basically beaten by an adult woman friend as a minor. Never mind the fact that Johnson’s character reacts none to the fact that he was underage and where BSDM starts, sex finishes, especially in this movie. If he was re-living his dominant-submissive experiences on the dominant side this time, he was definitely raped statutorily for many years. That’s anecdotal though, right? No one really cares about that. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever. Pushing that aside, too, we’re still left with a sliver of a relationship dynamic. During “contract negotiations” he offers her one date night a week. Well, Mr. Pompus Asshole, thanks so much for allowing her to have a shred of kindness from you beyond superficial shit you buy her every week. It’s so nice that you’re willing to come down off your massive ivory entitlement tower and be a real human. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this whole movie, I honestly wanted to tell him to go fuck himself. The acting was bad, but that’s not a big deal. Acting is bad is a lot of romantic drama comedies. I hated his character and not in a good way. When the movie entered the final scene, I hated his character, but I hated E. L. James and the director this bucket of crap we call a movie even more. To think that it would be some woman’s fantasy to be downright assaulted to tears and that it’s a good thing is selfish, disgusting, and downright fucked up. After the movie ended, I realized one thing. The books were written by a woman who has issues. She probably enjoys all of this shit and what better way to live it out but in a book and eventually a movie? Who wouldn’t like to see their fantasies played out like that? People have been saying that there’s nothing wrong with a woman putting her fantasies on paper, and normally I would agree with that statement. This time, however, I can’t believe that a woman would only want a man to beat her, shove shit up her butt and vagina, and be OK with zero emotional contact. It all reeks of unresolved issues from both parties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but wonder if I’m just over-reacting and not taking the movie-book smack fest at face value, so I turned to two sites that would either confirm my suspicions that I’m not the only one who feels this way or demonstrate that I’m turning into an old man and should just say home and let the kids do their kinky shit. Fandango.com was a waste of time. The reviews there were basically fangirls freaking out that there were people out there who think it’s all a pile of shit and padding the ratings to defend whatever fucked up love story they think the first 50 Shades of Grey resembled. IMDB.com told a much different story. Where Fandango had 15,000-something “reviews” with 4/5 on average, IMDB had 393,000-something people who marked it at an average 3.2/10. Granted one does not have to write a review to rate a movie and it’s pretty easy to pad the ratings on IMDB, but the reviews (only 400 or so) told a more accurate story. It was hard to find someone who saw the movie and actually liked it. There weren’t any screaming fangirls, here. No one shouting “I want Grey’s babies” or anything of the sort. Just people saying abuse is not romance and this movie shouldn’t be treated as anything remotely romantic. At least I’m not alone in thinking that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the movie ended, I asked my wife if it gets better. She tells me things get much better in the 2nd and 3rd books, and they end up getting married. That’s great. We could have boiled down those three books into one movie, though. No need for three. Man has problems, meets girl, girl tries to fix him, girl fixes him, they get married. The end. I pretty much described every romantic dramedy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also easy for me to sit here and basically hate on this movie, the books, and E. L. James. And if you were to tell me that to my face, you’d be right. It’s super easy, thank to the Internet. But as someone who came into the whole scene without any prior information or knowledge about what happens in the story, it’s also super easy for me to make an unbiased judgement about the story, the premise, the characters, and make hypotheses about what’s going through E. L. James’ head. My opinion is just that, mine, and I’m sure there’s a whole host of people out there—mostly women, I’m sure—who’d think I’m just another dick who just doesn’t understand that all Steele wants is to make him love because she loves him. Sorry to break your world of fantasy, but I figured that one out on my own, already. See the last couple of paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this movie could be worse. The acting was meh, the art direction was pretty good, and it was in Seattle. The characters are good looking, sure, but I’m sure the extent of male satisfaction was just to see Dakota Johnson take it from behind. I can’t even try to describe what women are seeing in this whole thing. I get the teasing and foreplay, but the pain and beating just seems odd and unresolved-issue laden. I may never know, and that’s fine. For the sake of supporting my wife, I may go see the 2nd and 3rd movies, if they ever actually hit theaters (or go straight to disc, like all paltry sequels) and hope to God that Grey stops being such a dick. I’ve never wanted to reach through the screen and blow someone’s brains out all over their marble floors like I did with him… I know what happens, but as it stands right now, I hate him (and people like him). &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time to Stop Hounding McDonalds</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/14/mcdonalds/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-14T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/14/mcdonalds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not going to change anything. I follow McDonalds on Facebook. A lot of people do. I do it because I like McDonalds. I eat it more than I should but that’s a different story altogether. I find it fascinating that people troll McDonald’s Facebook page almost without reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the below series of “questions” asked by commenters of a post McDonalds made about their eggs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-14-10.07.12.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consume those mind-numbing questions and let’s discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1. Pink Slime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes up every time. There’s a turd bucket out there who insists they’re right no matter what and asks the company &lt;em&gt;yet again&lt;/em&gt; if they use Pink Slime in their meat. Let’s not forget this whole thing was discussed recently in great detail, already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2. Sauce on Bagel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know how to look up ingredients for anything, you could probably figure this one out on your own which is a great transition into the third comment. I’ll admit not everyone thinks about that, but it’s 2015 and clearly they have Internet access. I’m not one to give the benefit of the doubt if it’s not warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3. French Fry Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone’s never made french fries in stupid large volumes before. Someone’s never made french fries on their own before, period, I’m guessing. It requires a few extra ingredients to execute such tasks on the scale McDonalds needs. This was something they discussed in great detail already, too. Someone wasn’t present for that, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#4. Egg McMuffin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone goes to a crappy restaurant. Probably a good idea to change? Product support on a company’s Facebook page is the best kind there is, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#5. Egg Beaters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone didn’t read. Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#6. More Egg Beaters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One likely disgruntled employee is obviously right. Reading must really not be a thing, anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It pretty clearly sounds like I’m a McDonalds supporter. And to an extent, I might be, as much as I enjoy eating their food. I’m also a supporter of not being stupid. Clearly trolling is the best tactic to making sure a company fails. I won’t ever say McDonalds is even remotely good for you, but things really have to be done a certain way in order to be made and run on the scale that McDonalds operates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will disagree with me, and that’s fine. I don’t care. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I brought my computer with me on the bus this morning to see if I could write while riding and came to one horrible conclusion. It’s impossible. One thing bus manufacturers haven’t thought about it making enough space for people to do work comfortably. What’s up with that? Then there’s those crazy side-facing seats. I unfortunately was limited to one of those for a place to sit, if I didn’t want to share with someone and have them look over my shoulder. Aside: don’t think the person next to you isn’t glancing down at your screen. I’m talking to you, co-workers who work for one of the biggest software companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above paragraph was written solely while riding public transportation. As it turns out, it’s incredibly hard to do. The seats are too close together. Maybe I have too big of a computer. Perhaps wanting to have a decently-sized keyboard and a good screen to look at is too much to ask. I should be using an iPad these days, right? Or better yet, just blogging on my phone because that’s what the kids do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever. I want to use my computer. There’s not much else to this post besides me complaining that I can’t blog on the bus the way I want to. I should probably just stick to blogging at my desk. I seem to enjoy it much more, there. Plus, there’s no one looking over my shoulder as I type. (fact: big pet peeve)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thinking About Old Posts</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/13/thinking-about-old-posts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looking back on old posts isn’t really something that I do on a regular basis. Once I’m all set and posting my words, that’s pretty much it. I have a good reason, though. If I started going back and reviewing my past posts, I feel like I might end up second guessing my work before I post it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one time I go back and review that doesn’t have to do with copy editing. When I feel like formatting suffered or something just didn’t turn out right, then I’ll for sure review it. If I’m talking about a particular topic and I find a link to share after the fact, I might link it in the post later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the first time around is usually the most genuine with writing, the words we say, or any mixture of the two. I try to keep it that way as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Office Online Update Bring Better PDF Stuff and Other Stuff</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The update’s file management improvements include the ability to save a copy of a file to OneDrive and select a new location in different folders to store the document. … Microsoft has added a Save As option, where the user can choose from Save As, Rename, Download a Copy, or Download as a PDF.There’s now a one click option to save files to OneDrive via a new Add to OneDrive button on the toolbar for Excel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also tidied up the start page to make it faster to begin editing a document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bing also gets promoted via the Tell Me function in Help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Office, I really do. it’s hard to find a really good alternative these days. Apple’s offerings were neutered a couple years ago, and the open source alternatives just seem janky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one could print to PDF with Chrome for like years, now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yesterday a new website and database launched called NoFlyZone.org, which invites people to enter their home address to prevent amateur drone pilots from zooming over their property, GoPro running. The database is maintained by a team of 10 people based in El Segundo, California, and led by Ben Marcus, a private pilot and drone operator.I have a pretty good idea what organizations won’t be using this database.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest “duh” technologies that we got in the last year or two was the phone kill switch. Lose your phone? Nuke it from orbit. Phone stolen?

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0LF09520150211?irpc=932&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thefts involving smartphones have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing “kill switches” that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen, authorities said on Tuesday.That’s great. Now if only there was some way to educate the remaining group of individuals responsible for stealing phones anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As you think, so shall you become. &lt;br /&gt;
– UnknownIt’s powerful stuff but the words speak a simple message. We’re surrounded my many different influences that can shape our thoughts and actions, but the biggest influence is ourselves. We’re the ones that make the final decision on whether to act a certain way, and those decisions are based on the thoughts we have. Having a positive mind leads to leading a positive life, but one cannot have the latter without the former. It cannot be expected that by being negative and pessimistic on the inside will still allow for an upbeat life on the outside. Take care of yourself by taking care of where your head is at. It’s the first and biggest step to improving anything and everything else around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen such a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/118471437&quot;&gt;story about a bridge&lt;/a&gt;? Neither have I. At roughly ten minutes in length, Lightning Boy Studio comes at us with a great animated tale with no speaking on two men who were determined to fix or rebuild a bridge that had fallen away into a vast canyon. A couple years ago, this video was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1662185920/le-gouffre-animated-short-film&quot;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt; that passed its goal by 5x.

   <title>The Desire to Write</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/10/desire</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My desire to write continues to grow. When I first start at the beginning of the year, I was writing once a day, and I felt like that wouldn’t be sustainable so I &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart&quot; title=&quot;Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year&quot;&gt;told myself&lt;/a&gt; I would write a few times a week. Turns out, I enjoy it a lot more than I thought I did. Writing has given me an opportunity to not just put my thoughts on digital paper and share with the world, but be able to look back at things that happened over the last day or so and reflect on them if I feel said topics are important. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/311/desk-overview&quot; title=&quot;Just Sit Down and Write with Desk&quot;&gt;great app&lt;/a&gt; to write with, and fortunately my wife support me. It’s hard to say if I’d ever make it a career but as it stands right now, I could write about stuff for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows what 2015 will hold. The summer will bring a whole host of &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/246/scared-to-act&quot; title=&quot;Scared to Act&quot;&gt;new changes and new experiences&lt;/a&gt; for my family and I’m excited and terrified, but mostly excited.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apple World.Today</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/10/apple-world-today</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From out of the Ashes of The Unofficial Apple Weblog comes Apple World.Today and &lt;a href=&quot;http://appleworld.today&quot;&gt;it looks to be great&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to see some of the former editors firing up another site and continuing the never ending task of brining us great Apple news. Steve Sande, Dave Caolo, and Kelly Hodgkins are  steering the new ship and hope to bring us some great content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our goal with Apple World Today is to pick up where TUAW left off as a source of news and reviews. But we want to take the site to you, the readers, by offering discussion forums (are we crazy to do this?), podcasts, and more video content. Wherever possible, we want to get our audience engaged by joining with us in online and live on-the-air discussions.Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AWT is a relative baby in the world of blogging about that company from Cupertino, and as such you can expect us to poop ourselves on a regular basis as we get used to our new home.I hope the rough analogies to new, non-house-trained pets don’t continue, though. &lt;img src=&quot;https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Morning Musicals</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/09/morning-musicals/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/09/morning-musicals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few people have asked what music I listen to in the morning while I’m mentally prepping for my day (by writing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I answer, I want to disclose that my tastes change from time to time, so the genres of music listed below might not be similar in any way. What you see is just want I’m listening to right now, courtesy of Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;classical&quot;&gt;Classical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only have one classical playlist I listen to, and it works well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:spotify:playlist:1oXl0OHlE1mPDChMa8Y0Ax&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acoustic&quot;&gt;Acoustic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dabble with acoustic music, too, just as I do classical. Instrumental music, I feel, is the best uber-genre of music when trying to concentrate or focus because then words someone is saying or singing don’t distract. I’m easily distracted. It’s not a super long playlist so I don’t listen to it all the time. The last thing I need is monotony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:spotify:playlist:0PRs1Xaui4zCv9LdIIt20X&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;electronic&quot;&gt;Electronic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few electronic playlists make the cut for my morning rituals. I have to be careful that there aren’t too many songs that have distinct beats that can be jarring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:spotify:playlist:65y98W0UItf73DJKVgylTP&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:spotify_uk_:playlist:6Jx9TYReeElpkvNWg8AzWm&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:spotify:playlist:67nMZWgcUxNa5uaiyLDR2x&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

   <title>The Best Way I Make Life Changes</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/09/life-changes/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/09/life-changes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some may say it takes time to change a habit, and they’d probably be right. From what I’ve read, it takes upwards of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/02/how-long-it-takes-to-form-a-new-habit/&quot;&gt;three weeks&lt;/a&gt; to fully break a habit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t stopped me from going cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started blogging every back in January, I decided I was going to do it in the morning, before I left for work, since not all of us have time to focus when we get home in the evening. The early mornings (4-5:30am) are typically the quietest around my house so it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I did to get my morning routine to support this new style of getting with the program Monday-Friday was to adjust my sleeping habits. Based on the typical 90 minute sleep cycle, I figured out when I could reasonably go to bed and be able to wake at around the same time every morning. This meant that overall I would get less sleep, but from what I can tell so far, waking up at the right time versus the last minute has helped a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really changed around cold turkey was my morning routine as a whole. I made the decision to do things differently and just went with them. As much as I wanted to sleep in, I was more motivated by not having to rush around in the morning. As I write this, I look at the clock and can tell I would still be asleep if I hadn’t started this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really made things better for me as I start my day. I don’t feel as crappy and want to take as big of a nap at 10am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the cold turkey thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t gradually work myself up to waking up an hour to 90 minutes earlier every day. I just did it. I rolled back my alarm clock and that was that. No dancing around the issue. If I was going to do it, I might as well do all of it and get used to it right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might take three weeks to break a habit, but the desire to improve overwhelms that if one genuinely wants to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/09/codeacademy-ipad-one-hour</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I’m working on is improving my software development skills. In 2015, along with everything else, I want to be much better at programming and development. One tool I used when I first started, and revisited again last night, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-code-hour/id762950096?mt=8&quot;&gt;CodeAcademy on the iPad&lt;/a&gt;. A great app that teaches you the super basics so other languages don’t seem so daunting. It’s free, and anyone can use it. Give it a whirl and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-code-hour/id762950096?mt=8&quot;&gt;download it from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. I mentioned it was free, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re done, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeacademy.com&quot;&gt;full site&lt;/a&gt; and start learning more advanced stuff. If you’re totally new to coding, start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;. In this day and age, it never hurts to know it. If you’ve already been through all of their stuff and want more, check out the post I wrote not too long ago listing other great sources for learning to code. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shadow of Mordor &#8211; a.k.a Shadow of Difficult Awesomeness</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/08/shadow-of-mordor/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/08/shadow-of-mordor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t play many videos games at the same time for one reason: I don’t have time. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy playing video games as much as the next mid-20s male. When I do have time to play a game, it has to be some thing I really want to play and play actively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I picked up Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. This is one of those games where I looked at it for some time and never bit the bullet but then one day my wife gifts it to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing it yesterday, and am playing it as I write this and one thing jumped out right away: it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by hard I mean: I died a lot. The game itself isn’t very hard. It’s actually about on par with what I would expect for this style of gameplay. The problem lies from the idea that one can fire up the game and start slaughtering the world around them, and that’s definitely not true. The missions are in place for a reason: complete them. If you don’t, you’ll likely be missing out on some cool powers and upgrades that’ll keep you from dying so much later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MiddleEarthShadowofMordorFirst30MinutesGameplay-42.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I realized that, I started mastering the art of slaughtering orcs and boy is it fun. As the story progresses, you start climbing the ranks of orcs and knocking them down, one by one. Don’t lose to them too often, though, as they’ll become more powerful and bring more friends with them, making them hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ejrbrg5ciei5kyolvltw2.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you set your sights on a target, you want to do everything you can to take them down right way. Don’t half-ass your assassination attempt and be really good at countering attacks. They’ll knock you down and put you on your back in no time and before you know, you’ll be respawning. Learn each captain’s vulnerabilities, it’ll make life much easier for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shadow-mordor-review-12.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, have fun. I really enjoy the game now that I know how to play it. Because I know how to play it, it’ll take longer to finish and grant me more reward for completing the smaller things, giving me that ever so needed satisfaction of progression and completion.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m always looking for a new tool, app or service that can give me a leg up when it comes to investing and making it as painless as possible which is why I’m covering three tools that can help you invest and save with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acorns&quot;&gt;Acorns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_appstore_screenshots.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They get their name from the same idea that squirrels have: when you find an acorn, you bury it in the ground and save it for winter. In this case, however, we’re not burying our money when we have extra change, we’re investing it.﻿﻿﻿ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acorns.com&quot;&gt;Acorns&lt;/a&gt; is an iOS and Android app that allows you to take the spare change from each of your regular purchases you make on a debit or credit card and invest it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, You spend $5.49 on coffee on Monday morning so you roll up that $5.49 to $6.00 and the remaining $0.51 is invested. You can do this automatically via the app or on your own, if you wish. It’s easier to think about than it seems because once you get into the habit of expecting all your purchases to be rounded to the next dollar, it’s cake. Personally, I do it manually, and that might work for you as well. They require minimum deposits of $5.00 so once your roll-ups reach that amount, a deposit will occur into your Acorns account (if you do it automatically). You can also have Acorns make regular deposits as well on a recurring basis if you so desire. You can even deposit your cashback you get on your credit cards! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acorns offers five different investment plans, with each one having a unique blend of stocks (via ETFs) and bonds, depending on your style. If you’re looking for growth, a more aggressive plan will be more to your liking, while a conservative plan is better for keeping your capital locked in on a slow but steady path. You can use the app to determine how much your money might grow over time with their projection graphs and see how your money is doing on the home screen day by day. As an added bonus for Android users, you can see your account’s value in real time via their widget on your home screen! As an iPhone user, this is something that I’m actually very envious about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acorns is free on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acorns-invest-spare-change/id883324671?mt=8&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acorns.android&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and takes roughly two business days to be fully signed up as they are an investment firm and have to follow the same rules as everyone else. They’re also open only to users within the United States (as they need a social security number). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;betterment&quot;&gt;Betterment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_betterment_screenshots.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a long-term play and want a platform that can help you do some serious investing, Betterment is the game you want to play. ﻿Signing up is dead simple and their plans help you find a good place to start putting your money. On their homepage, all you need to do is punch in your age, if you’re retired, and how much you make, and they’ll cook up three awesome plans for you to choose from, starting with saving to create an emergency fund/nest egg. Having one of these is important as sometimes life happens and one should never rely on credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re signed up and verified, you can browse your account on their site or using their mobile app. Their plans are similar to Acorns in that your money is automatically allotted into specific categories of ETFs based on how the money is to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to make sure I note is that unlike Acorns and RobinHood, Betterment does have a fee structure that you should be aware of, even though it’s super small and if you’re actively investing, you’ll barely notice. Their fee structure is based on your investment amount and they even provide an equivalent cost per month in real dollars and cents. For someone investing under $10,000 to start, they’ll be looking at an annual rate of 0.35% or roughly one dollar per month. This entry level plan requires a minim $100 auto-deposit every month. If you’re not comfortable with that yet or just don’t have the cash to make that kind of deposit, yet, don’t worry. Betterment assesses a flat fee of $3 per month for accounts with deposits of less than $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At $10,000, an investor can see the annual rate drop to 0.25% which will run roughly two dollars per month. (It’s important for me to note that the lower rate doesn’t start until $10,000 so an investor with $9,999 will be subject to the higher 0.35% minimum rate.) If you’re an investor who might be rolling in it and is working with $100,000, the rate drops again to 0.15% or roughly $13 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each step to higher better pricing structures, you’ll be offered additional services such as Tax Loss Harvesting ($50,000 minimum) and a personal advisor ($500,000 minimum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are unsure about the whole idea, rest easy with a 30-day no-cost intro option. At the end of 30 days, you’ll be placed into a plan based on your deposit status during the 30-day window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Betterment app is available for free on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/betterment-smarter-investing./id393156562?mt=8&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterment&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;robinhood&quot;&gt;RobinHood﻿&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_robinhood_screenshots.png?resize=753%2C268&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RobinHood is probably the slickest of the three app-services I describe here, today. One thing that’s plagued investors for a long time is that every time you make a trade, you have to pay a fee. That’s all fine and dandy if you have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars you’re moving around at any one time. A $250,000 trade minus $10 is nothing (0.004%, to be exact). For those who have smaller portfolios, say around the $1k to $10k range, those $10 fees add up ($10 from $1000 is 1%, a 250x increase). RobinHood’s goal is to stop making that a problem. They make their money off of you being their customer, so they don’t really need to charge you &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; per trade. Like Acorns, RobinHood is an app-only service so you can’t trade on your computer (yet). It’s technically not open to the public yet but they have been ramping up their beta enrollment quite a bit as of late. It’s definitely work looking into as it gives anyone with any amount of money access to buy stock without having to worry about losing a large fraction of their money every time they buy and sell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sign up to get yourself on the waiting list at  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robinhood.com&quot;&gt;robinhood.com&lt;/a&gt; and get the app on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-$0-commission-stock/id938003185?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a financial advisor. I recommend these products and services because I believe they offer a great service for users. Don’t trade with money you can’t afford to lose. All services mentioned above are SEC Registered Investment Advisors. Brokerage services are provided to clients via Acorns Securities, Betterment Securities, and Robinhood Financial, LLC, members &lt;a href=&quot;http://finra.org/&quot;&gt;FINRA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sipc.org/&quot;&gt;SIPC&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Through an Open Window</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/06/open-window-night/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/06/open-window-night</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve never liked about being up early in the morning is how dark it is outside throughout the winter. It’s hard getting up at 4AM and seeing nothing but the same darkness you saw when you went to bed the night before. Sure there’s a lot of excitement to be had at night, but for those of us with responsibilities, that’s just not an option. Instead I’m indoors, wondering what’s going on in the wee hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late night and early morning can lead to a lot of great inspiration for when my list of things to talk about is running on fumes. With my regular stents of barfing my brain onto the internet now (practically every day), I have to now take to task the idea that I’m also responsible for regular creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the night is so interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are people attracted to the darkness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are day-time clubs even a thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ponder all of these things, and more on a regular basis. Personally, I’ve never been one to go to a night club. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been to night clubs before, and back then it was mildly amusing having some girl rub her sweaty butt crack on me; don’t you think for one second that guys are the only ones that sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, it’s not even remotely interesting. Perhaps it has something to do with the idea that I grew up and care about more substantial things in life. If I wanted to pay $20 to drink, listen to overly loud music, and look stupid, I could do that at home, for free. Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hAAAB5DC6.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hAAAB5DC6.gif?resize=500%2C323&quot; alt=&quot;hAAAB5DC6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night also harbors the second and third shift folks who keep the world running while we all sleep. I know this because I used to be one. Working 4PM to 1AM was awesome when I was 21, single, and caring little about getting up at noon every day. It was great. Leaving work at 1AM led to the most delicious Jack in the Box burgers anyone has ever tasted. They do something differently in the middle of the night because they tasted so much better. Maybe it was just my desire for greasiness in the middle of the night that made me feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this pondering and reflecting on the night makes me wonder about a possible side project: regular stories about fictional people based on real people out being adventurous at night. Sounds like it could be good. One concern I have is how often I will be willing to stay up late at night and take notes. I sure as hell can’t magically come up with stories. The tales have to have some sort of truth behind them; that’s what makes them great! Otherwise, it’s just another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more brainstorming is on the way…when the sun comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>State of Organized Chaos</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/05/organized-chaos/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-05T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/05/organized-chaos</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my writing space. One would think that with my constant writing and seemingly never ending list of things to talk about, I’d have a super clean and awesome space to write that wasn’t the least bit distracting. Turns out, I’m not a super huge fan of minimalist spaces. I like having things to look at. When I’m pondering, it gives me something to study that ultimately leads me to my words. My last post about Dr. Better came solely because I was drinking one and the bottle was sitting right next to me. I could do to clean it up a bit, but I don’t feel that’s a super high priority. If was to organize my chaos a bit, those flowers wouldn’t move. That’s my wife’s wedding bouquet. She makes the final say on where that sits, and I kindly oblige. (Plus, she shares the desk, too, on occasion, so it’s only fair.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Mystery of Dr. Better</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/05/dr-better/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-05T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/05/dr-better</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story. A story about Dr. Better. See, Dr. Better wasn’t just good, he was better. Better than you and better than me. Dr. Better had a special talent. What was that talent, you ask? Why, being better, of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might be wondering, exactly what was he better at? Let me tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Better was better at being better… cola. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cola?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Cola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Better was better at Cola than anyone else who claimed to be better. One could argue Dr. Better was the best. Even if he was, he was still better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Dr. Better’s not a mystery, one could wonder if Dr. Better could be a better mystery, too…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Telling People&#8217;s Stories</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/telling-stories/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/telling-stories</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The great advantage of being a writer is that you can spy on people. You’re there, listening to every word, but part of you is observing. Everything is useful to a writer, you see—every scrap, even the longest and most boring of luncheon parties. ~ Graham GreeneThere’s so much right with this quote. I won’t say I’m a spy, but I find other people’s conversations amusing. I’m also pondering something…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote got me wondering this morning what would happen if more people told their stories? There’s hardly a shortage of drama in the news today surrounding things like black rights, domestic violence, discrimination, education, and so on that if everyone told their story, I can’t help but believe something would actually be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about this for a moment. There are X number of rape cases every year, right? (I leave the number as X because the quantity is irrelevant for this scenario) One of the biggest things surrounding rape and sexual assault is more often than it should be, the victim doesn’t come forward. What if the victim had a place to express their feelings without fear of being persecuted or being in danger? From a writing perspective and then from a sociological perspective, imagine how much more we’d hear about it? I’m not just talking about women, either. Sure the number of cases against men are significantly smaller but that doesn’t matter. Woman or man alike, being able to freely express oneself is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s what blogging’s good for: telling a story and sharing with others. On the Internet, one can hide behind a persona while still telling stories that are real, dirty, sad, exciting, or any combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s bring it back in to my original point. If I’m sitting on a park bench one day, and there’s a conflict between someone or a situation is happening, in my mind, I would want to tell that person’s story. What happens to everyone is important. If I saw someone being beaten by anyone—not just a cop—I would want to share that with the world: “Hey everyone. This guy is going through stuff no one should have to experience. Let’s do something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s the victim or a third party, telling stories people have would be a great way to connect us, bypassing our differences, and using our common struggles as a bond. When one person comes forward, more are likely to follow. Someone has to take the first step, however.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Favorite Super Bowl Commercials</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/super-bowl-commericals/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/super-bowl-commericals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When my favorite team (Seattle Seahawks) isn’t playing in the Super Bowl, I’ll still watch for the commercials. I enjoy an ad that tells a story, or makes me feel something. I won’t likely buy anything that ad was selling, but I don’t think it’s always about that. These multi-million dollar spots aren’t about selling stuff, they’re about creating a memory; if executed properly, you’ll remember that commercial for weeks, to come… something they can’t say about tv commercials every other day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a rundown of my favorites and why. Be warned: the list is long (I have many favorites) and there is a lot of feels… &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dodge--wisdom&quot;&gt;Dodge – Wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JKKlqMs19tU?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those ads that makes me stand up and clap. See, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dodge.com&quot;&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt; makes &lt;a href=&quot;http://dodge.com/cars&quot;&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;. They make cars that &lt;a href=&quot;http://dodge.com/charger&quot;&gt;go fast&lt;/a&gt;. They also make cars that are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drivesrt.com&quot;&gt;stupid fast&lt;/a&gt;. They’re going through their 100 year anniversary. What better way to show off their fleet of ass kickers than to find 100 year old ass kickers to put you in your place! Grandpa doesn’t want you to be a little bitch. Rock on, grandpa. Rock on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bud-light--real-life-pacman&quot;&gt;Bud Light – Real Life PacMan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9A1NowrnGI?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anheuser-Busch steps up their game yet again with another bro who’s literally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/upforwhatever&quot;&gt;#UpForWhatever&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure some of this was scripted, but who cares. That looks like a party I’d want to go to. I might… just might… drink _one _Bud Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skittles--settle-it&quot;&gt;Skittles – Settle It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JDwRN2GBUj8?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me thinks those beefed up right arms aren’t for arm wrestling. Kinda weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nfl--together-we-make-football&quot;&gt;NFL – Together, We Make Football&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ul29X69UJA?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah we do. This basically sums up those tense, last-minute moments. Not super intense but pretty truthful, overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doritos--when-pigs-fly&quot;&gt;Doritos – When Pigs Fly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQo0TfuueaY?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know &lt;a href=&quot;http://doritos.com&quot;&gt;Doritos&lt;/a&gt; would step it up again this year. They can’t not. They’ll stop making cool ads when pigs fly. Oh wait… crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;budweiser--lost-dog&quot;&gt;Budweiser – Lost Dog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAsjRRMMg_Q?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave it to Anheuser-Busch take the crown for the feels award. They know lost puppies pull heart strings. They know how to pull them good, too. No, I’m not crying… I just got some Doritos in my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coca-cola--makeithappyhttptwittercommakeithappy&quot;&gt;Coca-Cola – &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#MakeItHappy&quot;&gt;#MakeItHappy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibgvkXm9Qkc?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola gets a feels award, too, for this ad. In a world where we’re hating on each other day in and day out because hiding behind a computer screen on the Internet and trashing someone’s life makes you powerful. Pro tip: you look like an idiot. Good job, Coca-Cola for trying to remind people that hate doesn’t belong on the Internet, or really anywhere for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not tired of the feels, yet, are you? Good. Dove knows that staying fresh and clean is important to raising children and being a good role model for them. I don’t have kids, but I can imagine it’d be hard to do so with a lingering stink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feels train is barreling into the station. Always makes a great point that girls in our society are at their lowest regrind their self-esteem. It’s no wonder so many turn out like they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite, for sure. It’s likely in my top three, now that I think about it. It’s long at 1:31, but it’s real. As someone who loves exploring and photographing nature and the world around me, I gravitate towards stuff like this. This is one of the few commercials in this list that makes me want to buy something like what they’re selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been on a Carnival cruise, but I really appreciate this spot. The lack of sound effects and listening to the speech along with powerful and sweeping images of cool places and things Carnival supposedly lets you do makes me appreciate it as a presentation more than an advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;toyota--my-bold-dad&quot;&gt;Toyota – My Bold Dad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1AB8zA7YOtw?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our break from the feels is over. Dad definitely was a theme across several of these commercials this year. There’s nothing wrong with that, at all. Here’s a few more feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-more&quot;&gt;No More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJaSj_qipic?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, I’ve been making jokes about the feels, but this one is no laughing matter. Yes, it’s heart-wrenching for some, but it damn well should be. Domestic violence is a real thing. Don’t pretend it’s not. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nissan--with-dad&quot;&gt;Nissan – With Dad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bd1qCi5nSKw?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of the dad-themed spots in my list. Nissan knows how to advertise their fleet and give a few feels at the same time. It had everyone in my party watching, even though we weren’t entirely sure what it was about at first…. but those feels…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chevrolet&quot;&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;882&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHS426cnNBA?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last one had my butt puckering for a bit. With a decent sized gathering at my house to watch the game, the last thing I wanted was for Comcast to start trolling and cut my service. This commercial made me think my worst nightmare came true. Good job, Chevrolet, I’ll give you points for that… just don’t do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Music</title>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/music</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Music is one of those things: you either like it or you’re weird. Music for me is a way to eliminate the distractions surrounding me and enter the world the artist as created. Any genre of music can work. If it’s Taylor Swift, that world exists just as much as Vivaldi’s. As I write this, I’m actually just sitting back in my chair with my eyes closed. It’s good that I can type without looking (there’s always spell check, too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music is a gateway to your imagination. It stimulates your brain into opening up your creativity and letting flower new ideas and at the same time lets our hone in on existing ones. For some, music is purely claiming. For others it gets them amped up. I’m sure the type of music has something to do with that, no doubt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get started early in the morning, Spotify gets started with me. If you’re not using Spotify or another service like it to get your music, you’re missing out. As buying CDs is dying, buying singles from iTunes or similar is dying. I pay the equivalent of two trips to Starbucks every month for unlimited music in all categories, for whatever listening events I desire. It’s the best $10 I’ve ever spent to help me focus. Now how do I return these brain drugs I bought off the TV?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Facebook Despression</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Based on a survey of 700 students, the study found that users who engage in “surveillance use”–“brows[ing] the website to see how their friends are doing compared with their own lives”–versus simply using the site to contact friends and family can experience symptoms of depression.&lt;br /&gt;
—TechCrunchWell duh. One doesn’t need Facebook to get into the mindset of seeing another’s happiness and wish it was their own. This is why I advocate finding other sources of stimulation, like writing! Starting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com&quot;&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogger.com&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Where I Get My Stock Photos</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/awesome-stock-photos/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/awesome-stock-photos</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One would think that because I’m a photographer in some capacity that I would take all of my own photos. Let me tell you, that’s certainly not the case. One cannot craft a particular scene in a heartbeat with just enough time to post it to a blog. Good luck with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I use a lot of creative-commons based stock photography. I thought I’d put together a list of sites I source my imagery from in hopes that it helps you in your journey to finding great images for your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several primary sources I rotate through, depending on what time of the week it is. Most of these sites only update once a week or month with a new “pack” of images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;death-to-the-stock-photo&quot;&gt;﻿Death to the Stock Photo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deathtothestockphoto.com&quot;&gt;DTTSP&lt;/a&gt; has two models for delivering photos: free and premium. The free model allows you to receive photos in your email every month in a pack of about ten. They’re high quality images, large enough to print, even, if you so desired. With their premium model, you can get access to their whole archive, not just most recent images for $10 a month. I can’t say that about any big stock photo agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unsplash&quot;&gt;﻿Unsplash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com&quot;&gt;A side project&lt;/a&gt; by the visual design agency Crew, you’re granted ten new photos every ten days to do whatever you want with. You can view their past images by scrolling and all are was to download right from the site, no membership or sign-up forms required. The images and their themes vary from week to week so don’t hesitate to scroll down a ways and get into past months’ photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;raumrot&quot;&gt;﻿Raumrot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raumrot.com/10/&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; because they have categories. A lot of them feel a bit hipster in style but that’s all the rage now from what the kids tell me. Most if not all of their images are hosted on flicker so they’re easy to download. All they ask is a bit of attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;little-visuals&quot;&gt;﻿Little Visuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not as active anymore as some of the others, &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlevisuals.co&quot;&gt;their archive&lt;/a&gt; is good. They’re not my first choice anymore since they don’t seem to be updating the site with new images, but their archives have a gem once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-old-stock&quot;&gt;﻿New Old Stock﻿&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://nos.twnsnd.co&quot;&gt;great place&lt;/a&gt; for older images from the 1920s-1950s, and surrounding time periods. It’s amazing to look at some of these images as they’re genuinely pieces of history. &lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/04/adblock-plus-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember yesterday when I mentioned that AdBlock Plus was allowing companies to pay their way through the blocks to users?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to Ars, AdBlock Plus Communications Manager Ben Williams wrote that currently, the browser extension has granted a pass to “over 300 sites/entities” out of “over 1,500 applicants” to the company’s whitelist.Damn. Remind me again the point of AdBlock Plus?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/03/vacate</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The words “vacate” and “vacation” seem to have two very different connotations in our mind. Looking at news articles tells us just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vacation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what I mean? It’s actually a bit difficult to find an article about someone vacating their location and heading to Hawai’i, Milan, or Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Killing Your Friends when They Think You&#8217;re not Looking</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/03/killing-your-friends/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-03T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/03/killing-your-friends</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day for The Unofficial Apple Weblog. TUAW has been a staple in keeping up with the latest Apple news, products and happenings. The site was always a go-to of mine to keep up to date on rumors, and it did its job well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TUAW, for lots of reasons beyond our control, has no future, but Apple’s burns brightly. It’s been great writing about these growing technologies, and seeing and testing apps — some that were great and some that fell short. All of us here tried to tell the story of Apple and its offspring of hardware and software companies and tell it straight; the good along with the sometimes ugly.— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/2015/02/02/some-final-thoughts/&quot;&gt;Mel Martin&lt;/a&gt;, TUAW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure of what that first sentence means let me translate: “TUAW doesn’t write enough fluff. Engadget and TechCrunch do. AOL wants to keep them because fluff pieces make more ad dollars. Without ad dollars, AOL will we all die.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but think that’s why TUAW and coincidentally, Joystiq are taking their final ride today and heading out to pasture. While the revolution of digital media killed off many a good magazine (read: Macworld, Cat Fancy), having a digital publication that people actually enjoy murdered quietly is tough, too. I’m sure TC and Engadget will have plenty of space for the staff from TUAW and Joystiq, but they’re just not the same. Both are end-all-be-all properties that try to cater to everyone and in turn they lose a sliver of their credibility as being the authority on specific things. I wouldn’t trust my local Wal-Mart with high-nor would I trust Radio Shack, either—and I think it’s hard to put faith into a site that tries to pull in 20-somethings for gadget news and then turn around and write about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/mysecretluxury-is-a-concierge-service-for-romance-love-potentially-sex/&quot;&gt;concierge sex service&lt;/a&gt;. It never ended there, don’t even get me started on why &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/&quot;&gt;a porn site&lt;/a&gt; that really wasn’t that special was &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/&quot;&gt;newsworthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To each their own, I guess. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://imore.com&quot;&gt;iMore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com&quot;&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/&quot;&gt;ArsTechnica&lt;/a&gt; to go read.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>To Write, You Must Read</title>

  &lt;p&gt;“If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot…reading is the creative center of a writer’s life…you cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you.” ~ Stephen KingArguably one of the best fantasy and sci-fi writers of all time with almost four hundred different works written including such epic titles as Carrie, Salem’s Lot, It, Mr. Mercedes, Revival, and more, Stephen Kind makes a great point. With the onslaught of bite-sized media coming at us from all angles (tweets, status updates, Instagram photos) it’s now mainstream to only spend a few minutes reading about any particular topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, I enjoy bite-sized news as much as the next guy. When I’m checking social media, I’m doing it for one of two reasons: to get a quick update on the day and the world around me and to find something interesting to read about later. The key is the latter. I think if more people sat down and read a book (or at least listened to one), or even consumed more thoughtful and substantial information via something like a Podcast or another educational resource (a single-topic magazine, for example), we’d be overflowing with creativity as a people. Don’t get me wrong, there are loads of creative people in the world, already, and that’s awesome. But there are so many people that have so much to share, but don’t, for one reason or another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would have happened if Stephen King never published any of his works because he didn’t feel like they were interesting or he was a good enough writer? You never know who’ll come across your work someday, and in order to be good at writing, one has to be good at reading. I’ve consumed quite a few of Stephen King’s books, personally, and while I started writing for several reasons, his writing stimulated my creative juices in part just enough to help me get to the point where I write something every day of the week. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Magic Room</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/02/magic-room/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/02/magic-room</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve always pondered how much more productive I would be if I had a “dream office” to write and work in. Then I’ve thought about what that office would look like. In reality, I’m not exactly sure I could even come up with a solid example, just some abstract ideas. I sat down for a few minutes to ponder this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would your perfect writing/reading/working space look and feel like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my world, my writing space would have hard wood floors. Something dark, but not cherry or mahogany dark. I’d need a rolling chair, something that would support my back so I can sit upright. On my desk, I’d need a setup that allowed me to look straight ahead at my monitor or monitors and not have to tilt my head downward. I don’t know if I’d have a laptop, still, or switch to an iMac or similar. The desk itself would likely be minimalist in style, with maybe a drawer or small cabinet underneath to keep the clutter to a minimum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would need to have something playing music, probably a small speaker set behind me, nothing too loud or big so as to be distracting. A bookshelf would be nice, to hold all the books I don’t have (I’ll need to buy some books). I feel like the room would need a lot of light either from a window, from lighting fixtures, or both. The lighting can’t be harsh, though. When I’m up writing at 4:30 AM, the last thing I need is harsh light to work with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, I’d have to figure it out as I go along. Perhaps I can find some sort of genie in a magic bottle to grant me this writing space. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was looking over all the writing I did for the month of January and I can safely say that not only have I kept one of my New Year’s Resolutions so far, but I blew away my person goal I set for myself. I made a pact with inner me that I would write at least a few times a week and have them be something substantial. According to my count, I posted something 39 times in January and have over 20,000 words to show for it. By that count, with only spending roughly an hour a day writing, I could have a complete book written in a month if I wrote all day. Granted, I don’t have the attention span to do something like that but it makes me feel good to know that I’ve been able to not only meet a goal but to exceed it by a wide margin. &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/249/for-february&quot;&gt;I told myself a couple weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; that I would write more in February. In reality, the goals has essentially become “write the same amount as you’re currently doing in February.” Writing is something I enjoy quite a bit and have no intent on stopping.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Harry&#8217;s: Get a Good Shave Without Nicking Your Wallet</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/01/harrys/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-01T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/02/01/harrys</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To follow up my quick review of NatureBox yesterday, I received a second awesome package in the mail on Saturday. I recently ordered a new shave kit from a great company I hadn’t heard of until just recently called Harry’s. Harry’s does things a bit differently. Their claim to fame is they make all their own blades and firmly believe that charging a boat load of cash for a single replacement razor blade is dumb. Here’s what I thought of the kit when I first received it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1-000585039a409a575b2f9ef2714edc4c.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered the basic Truman set in dark blue. Other colors include orange,white, and green. With the kit, I received two extra blades, a blade protector, and shave cream (the image above shows gel, which is also an option). Everything I need to get started. Since I already have after-shave that I really like, I opted out of ordering some, for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the box arrived, it showed up in the mail. I could have ordered faster shipping but I think with enough foresight and planning, one could save money and still have their kit or replacement equipment show up on time. (more on their subscription option later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the box and the first thing I did was pull out the razor. With a blade pre-attached, I essentially had three blades at my disposal. The handle has some heft to it and I really like that. It’s curved and feels good in my hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1_harrys-delivery-002.png?resize=882%2C588&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shaving cream I opted for smells great and while the tube isn’t very large, it’s enough to get started. I don’t have to continue using their cream or gel if I don’t want, but who knows, I might go for it with their subscription options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subscribe-to-a-smooth-face&quot;&gt;Subscribe to a Smooth Face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a regular shaver, be it daily, every other day, or weekly, they have an option that’ll suit your needs. To prevent you from running out of razors, shaving cream, and after-shave, Harry’s will send you everything you need in the right intervals, automatically. Based on how often you shave, they’ll ship you two creams and eight blades every two, three, or five months for $31.00, or you can sign up for your own interval and include gel and aftershave at the interval you choose. ﻿Where else do you know that you can get eight high-quality blade cartridges for less $1.88 each and get shave cream or gel for $8 each? Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go sign up now with &lt;a href=&quot;http://harrys.com&quot;&gt;Harry’s&lt;/a&gt; and get equipment for a great shave for a great price.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NatureBox &#8211; Super Tasty Snacks in the Mail</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/31/naturebox/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-31T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/31/naturebox</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s one thing I’ve always liked and that is super delicious tasty snacks. On top of that, there’s bonus points involved if said snacks are salty. Or sweet. Or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received what some would call a “care package” in the mail today from a company called NatureBox. See, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;amp;b=395413&amp;amp;m=41415&amp;amp;afftrack=&amp;amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom&quot;&gt;NatureBox&lt;/a&gt; has this crazy idea that people really enjoy tasty snacks that won’t make you feel gross or regret eating them. I figured I’d give them a shot (I’ll help you do that, too, at the end of this article) and see what they’re all about. I used my ever amazing hookup powers to get a sampler box with four small snack pouches and one full-size bag of something mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I had to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I placed my order with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;amp;b=395413&amp;amp;m=41415&amp;amp;afftrack=&amp;amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom&quot;&gt;NatureBox&lt;/a&gt; on their site and within roughly a full calendar week, I had my box come in the mail. Remember what it was like when grandma sent her world-famous fruit cake to everyone when Christmas came around? Yeah, it’s nothing like that. NatureBox doesn’t do fruit cake, but they do mail stuff. The snacks come in a safe package that won’t let them get crushed or spoiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each full size snack bag is re-sealable, too, which is nice. I’d hate to get some delicious food and at the end of the week have it go bad because I didn’t get to it in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical order is five bags of goodies from their selection of over 100. If you have a food allergy, their site will filter out what you’re not keen on consuming, including nuts, gluten, eggs, lactose, and soy. Ordering is super easy and only take a couple minutes, just long enough to pick out what you want from their menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re too impatient, you can have them ship it out right away, instead of waiting around for your next monthly order to process. A five-snack box is $20 and you can go as high as 20 snacks for $50. Obviously, the more you get, the cheaper they are. If you have a large family or eat a lot of snacks, $50 can go a long way when a lot of the bags are rather hefty in size. The cranberry rice cake snack bag we received was four ounces and contained enough for four servings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of NatureBox’s snacks use only the best ingredients and they keep processed stuff out of their foods as much as possible. This means your sugars are pure cane and HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) is absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could justify ordering $50 worth of snacks in the mail every month, I would go for it. It’ll take a bit of time for my wife to be all right with that, so we’re sticking to the $20/five snack option. With that being said, if you’re not only interested in trying out NatureBox for yourself, but want to get $10 off your first order, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;amp;b=395413&amp;amp;m=41415&amp;amp;afftrack=&amp;amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom&quot;&gt;go to their site&lt;/a&gt; and use the code &lt;strong&gt;share10off&lt;/strong&gt;. When you tell your friends, tell them to use that code, too. They’ll appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I Solved Related Posts not Showing when Running WordPress, JetPack, and Nginx</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/30/related-posts/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/30/related-posts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started this blog up again at the beginning of January, I wanted to have related posts be visible at the end of each post. I use JetPack and I figured turning Related Posts on would be easy and I would be all set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned on Related Posts and discovered nothing was appearing. I knew there wasn’t really anything that could be wrong as I don’t have any errors in WordPress, PHP-FPM doesn’t report errors in any of my logs, and I can use other services like WordPress.com Stats and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some digging and after my search turned up nothing, I reached out to Automatic support and asked about my JetPack issue. We worked through a few things including making sure WordPress.com Stats was working, the JetPack servers could see my site (which they did). We even checked to make sure the plugin was even grabbing data to display in the first place. This can be done by adding ?relatedposts to the end of any single post URL. You’ll get a JSON blob in return if it’s doing what it’s supposed to on the back end. We figured, well, that can’t be it either. Turns out, the answer wasn’t anywhere where I was expecting it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem was with my Nginx server configuration for this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where it gets technical. For any path, you’ll have a set of URIs for the server to try before it gives up. The code usually looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, that’s right! WordPress will work just fine like this. You won’t notice errors and everything will parse fine… except for JetPack’s Related Posts plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, with the above line of code, we’re telling Nginx that it’s ok to try the URI by itself, with a slash after it, or try index.php by itself, depending on what the URI actually is. Nginx, however, is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; detail-oriented and will only do exactly what you tell it to do. In my case, I left out a specific instruction: process index.php with arguments, please. By doing so, we turn the above line of code into this line of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&amp;amp;$args
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the bold text starting with the question mark? that’s what we were missing. JetPack calls upon that JSON blob I told you about a bit ago just like that: index.php followed by the URI (not fancy, something like a post ID), and any additional arguments necessary after that. So in the case where my post ID is 105 and it’s grabbing the related posts for that, it would be calling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.php?q=105&amp;amp;relatedposts=1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this helpful. If you did, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;please let me know&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoy a good chat and meeting folks who enjoy blogging and WordPress as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Learn to Code as Early as You Can!</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/30/learn-to-code/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/30/learn-to-code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I always wish I would have paid more attention to when I was younger was coding. I believe my generation is just the start of the potential batch of humans that become masters of writing code and making apps that do random things. My problem is I feel like I’m a bit behind the curve because I didn’t pay as much attention to it nor did I have a solid path to learn code in the first place…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a huge demand for software developers. A lot of these developers went to school for computer science and built up the foundations necessary to be successful in that career. While I’m decent—I could hold my own if I was writing something with HTML/CSS, Python, or PowerShell—I think I would be even better if I had paid more attention. When I was younger, I didn’t care so much about stuff like that. I wasn’t interested in the future. I was interested in girls and just making it through high school. If I had really kept my nose in the books so to speak, I could have gone to a good school and today I would have a CS degree and likely be pretty good in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking. Just because I didn’t get a degree doesn’t mean I can’t excel at programming. You’re right. That’s why I’m good with the above languages I cited. I used to be good with PHP, too, but that was before high school and those brain cells rusted out; a lot has changed with PHP but it’s not foreign to me. I use WordPress every day and I can handle my own when reading and understanding code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to-learn&quot;&gt;Where to Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of resources out there to learn to code, some online and others in person. Here’s a good list from what I’ve discovered and personally think are fantastic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;online&quot;&gt;Online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeacademy.com&quot;&gt;Code Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.org&quot;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeschool.com&quot;&gt;CodeSchool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeavengers.com&quot;&gt;Code Avengers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girldevelopit.com&quot;&gt;Girl Develop It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com&quot;&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teamtreehouse.com&quot;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt;
### In Person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theironyard.com&quot;&gt;The Iron Yard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your Local University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coderdojo.com&quot;&gt;CoderDojo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerclubhouse.org&quot;&gt;Intel Computer Clubhouse Network&lt;/a&gt;
There are a lot more out there, I’m sure, but these are just the ones I’m familiar with. Not all services and locations will offer up the same courses, but I think there’s a good mix of online and in-person resources to get anyone to a good place to start making their own apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a solid foundation, it’s time to experiment and start making stuff. You’re at the point where you won’t get a high-paying software development job just yet, but it’s coming. Here are some ideas and idea lists to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-project-ideas-help-learn-programming-faster/&quot;&gt;5 Project Ideas To Help You Learn Programming Faster&lt;/a&gt; (Make Use Of)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/threads/131973/5-crucial-projects-for-beginners&quot;&gt;Five Crucial Projects for Beginners&lt;/a&gt; (DaniWeb)
I’ve combed through a lot of these resources myself and have used some of the earlier resources I listed for learning to code. I personally believe that if you have the time and resources to learn in-person, you’ll have a much better time. If you don’t, please don’t fret. You might be surprised by how much you can learn online. If you ever get stuck, the very popular Q&amp;amp;A site for whatever &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; has great sub-sites for various programming languages but their biggest is &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll find an answer there, I’d almost guarantee it. Your problem probably isn’t unique if you’re working on something that may have been done before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might have regrets about not learning to code sooner, but it’s also very much not too late to learn. With the amount of free resources, there’s no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonus&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an iPad app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-code-hour/id762950096?mt=8&quot;&gt;Code Academy – Hour of Code&lt;/a&gt; that also provides great resources on the basics of development and programming. If you have an iPad and want to learn the fundaments in an hour a day, give it a look. It’s free so you have nothing to lose and no excuse not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Start Before You&#8217;re Ready</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/29/be-ready/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-29T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/29/be-ready</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because you’ll never be ready if all you’re doing it waiting until you’re ready. At some point, one needs to take a leap of faith. I’m not talking about religious faith. I’m talking about taking a chance on yourself and believing that you can succeed. There are new challenges almost every day in life, and while we try to be as world smart as we can and prepare for them as much as possible, sometimes things just don’t go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something that I am working on myself, as I prepare for a life-changing move to California at the end of Spring. As someone who’s grown up and lived in the Seattle area my entire life, a move like this that involves a new, permanent location of living for at least ten years is frankly frightening. However, there isn’t an amount of preparation in the world that could prepare me 100% for something like this. I will never be 100% ready. I don’t have the data to support a hypothesis that if we move, zero bad things will happen. It’s easy to be cautious with that kind of idea, but that caution can also prevent me from continuing to do what I love and to support my wife and what she loves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>If I Could Change Just One Thing</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/28/inter-team-dynamics/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/28/inter-team-dynamics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I get it. Working with another team can suck at times. I’ve had my fair share of cases where I wasn’t exactly thrilled about the idea of working with a team of people who I didn’t believe were in the right position to be of assistance. While that’s certainly my opinion, it’s not my place to tell them they’re idiots. It’s also not appropriate. That’s not the only thing that bothers me about inter-team dynamics that seems all too common today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really grinds me gears is the lack of open communication between multiple teams and parties that exists, today. Most companies have several teams and aren’t on the scrappy startup level. Some companies have multiple teams doing one type of task, although that number is significantly less. I am in the second boat. More times than I can witness, no matter what management has described, open communication didn’t exist and to even suggest it did was nothing short of heresy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a comfort zone or bubble that builds up when a team has been around a while and has had the opportunity to essentially do things the way they want to do them for some time. That bubble becomes something the team wants to protect at all costs because its safe and it feels nice. To have that taken away for what would at first seem like no good reason because now there’s team B coming in and helping with the same type of tasks, it can feel threatening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation is amplified when team A tries to take the dominant position in the relationship and doesn’t even try to hide the fact that they’re trying to put team B into a lower, less useful-feeling place to perhaps push them back out. Think of it as a “good ol’ boys club” of sorts or even a country club. If you’re not a member of the special club or organization, then you’re nothing to them. You might as well golf in your backyard because you’ll never be doing it on their lush green grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would fix that, if I could. This is 2015, in case nobody noticed, not 1986. These scrappy startups and small companies are thriving because they’re kicking ass at being one cohesive unit. If anyone expects to continue to be successful or even succeed once, this relationship can’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, however, if it already exists, it won’t ever go away. This kind of dynamic comes from above. Subordinates tend to conform to how the rest of the team is moving. Changing something like this is hard if not impossible. In this scenario, someone will always be the redheaded step child. It’s about time we accept that and fire everyone who creates that type of environment. It’s not going to do anyone any good in the long run. It hurts morale and low morale hurts quality.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vivaldi &#8211; A New Browser for our Friends</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/27/vivaldi/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/27/vivaldi</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So there’s a new browser in town, put out by ex Opera big cheese Jón Stephenson von Tetzchner. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.net&quot;&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt; and so far, it looks just as good as Vivaldi’s music sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivaldi came to be after coming to the conclusion that Opera (the browser) just ain’t what it used to be. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.net&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;: “[Opera] is no longer serving its community of users and contributors who helped build the browser in the first place.” That’s a bummer. I liked Opera for a while, but then it started feeling super fat. It started feeling like Firefox. For what it’s worth, at the time, all third party browsers were feeling super bloated like they needed to have extra water drained out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot2015-01-2718.00.17.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded it just now and toyed around with it for a bit. Obviously, on a Mac, installing an app is simple to the point of condescension in most cases. Just drag and drop it into the Applications folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot2015-01-2718.01.58.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On launch, there’s not much going on. Once you start browsing sites, it’ll do what other browsers do and show you your most visited sites. The UI is flat and clean. It blends super well with the UI theme that OS X Yosemite carries, and doesn’t feel out of place. The tab idea must really be working with users because it seems quite similar to just about every other name brand browser out there, which is fine. There’s no sense in reinventing the wheel if your existing wheel is super fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1_Screenshot2015-01-2718.02.20.png?resize=882%2C551&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After launching a few sites, I noticed a really cool trend. The site icon that appears in the tab dictates the UI’s main color. The Vivaldi has a mostly red icon ergo the UI is the same shade red. Visiting The Great Discontent changes the UI to black, and Google to blue. It’s a subtle touch but is much appreciated. It takes the branding of the site the user is viewing and extends it over their whole screen. It’s almost as if the brand bleeds into the whole browsing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2_1_Screenshot2015-01-2718.02.38.png?resize=882%2C551&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;There are a load of cool features coming soon, according to the Vivaldi Web site including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail.&lt;/strong&gt; What’s better than a really good competitor to Gmail? Who says they have to eat all the cake?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmark/Notes/History/Session syncing across different devices.&lt;/strong&gt; Smells like a hint that mobile will be a real thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard-based (Spatial) Navigation.&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds like it could be good. Will have to wait and see how this turns out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Boosts.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing like a snappy quick browser. Even being slightly cracked out is OK, so long as it’s stable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensions.&lt;/strong&gt; Your browser needs to do so much more these days and they want to make sure that happens in the most secure method possible without impacting performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And More…&lt;/strong&gt; They’re taking suggestions from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.net/forum&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;!
Download: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.net&quot;&gt;Vivaldi.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to seeing what this baby can do, especially with the upcoming release from Microsoft of their new “Spartan” browser!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Favorite Thing to This Day</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/27/favorite-thing/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/27/favorite-thing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In school my favorite subject was “Computers.” At the time, I didn’t quite know what that meant, nor did I really care. Kids thought I was nerdy because computers weren’t cool. The popular kids didn’t care about computers, they were athletes. That’s how they made friends. That didn’t deter me from keeping up with what I enjoyed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with HTML in the 6th grade, and it escalated from there to include design and photography. Today, I work in IT at a rather large software company you might have heard of, and I enjoy it. If I had to change career paths at this very moment, the only shift I would make would be to photography, something that was stimulated by computers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experienced my first Mac around the 6th grade timeframe, too, but it was one of those colorful eMacs with the round one-button mice. I remember the next year my school bought newer white iMacs, still of the tube-television style one-piece setups, but the mice weren’t completely round anymore—though they still had one button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump forward a couple years later into high school, and that’s when I got to feel my first, what I felt like was a legit iMac. It was a behemoth at 27” in screen size and I was blown away by it. The resolution—all those pixels—and the ability to have so much on screen and be able to do it all at once!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my last real contact with a mac until I bought my own in 2011. Don’t get me wrong, I used Windows computers, too. I built my own gaming-purposed desktop in the beginning of 2011 and rocked it like no other. However, it didn’t stick with me like my 15” Macbook Pro did. That same Macbook Pro is sitting in front of me right now. It’ll be four years old in roughly eight months and while I sank a lot of money into that gaming desktop I built, I can’t say it would be running the same this many years later, without intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IT, I’ve supported Macs, PCs, Windows servers, Linux servers, and any blend of those four technologies. If It hadn’t been for my interest in computers from the very beginning (with a Packard bell 486DX2-66), I don’t think any of my interests I have today would have flourished in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Just Sit Down and Write with Desk</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/27/desk-overview/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/27/desk-overview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing pretty religiously for the last few weeks now—I officially started this new chapter on January 6th—and one thing I’ve failed to talk much about is what exactly I do my writing on. I could go into a huge, winded preamble about how the best software matters and this and that and the other thing, but I’ll spare you the sappy crap. The reality is, I have one app I use when I’m at my desk, tapping away at my keyboard, making words appear in sentence form on a screen. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://desk.pm&quot;&gt;Desk&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I use my computer on my desk, but on my computer is Desk. Boy that would be confusing if English wasn’t your first language. Anyway, without sounding two advertorial—sorry not sorry—I want to tell you a bit about the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1-Desk-App-Screenshot-Platforms.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desk is a minimalist writing app. To say it’s minimalist might not actually be the right word for it. It’s more of a digital, software-based representation of a spiral notebook. See, Desk serves one purpose: be that guy you always go to when you need to talk about some stuff write. It allows you to be as distraction-free as possible and maintain a sense of organization and being “with it.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desk supports most of the popular platforms as of version 1.1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WordPress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tumblr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facebook Notes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typepad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Squarespace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MovableType
Platforms such as Ghost are hopefully coming soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2-Desk-App-Screenshot-Speed.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing a post to any of your blogging platforms of choice takes but a few seconds, and with the option of enabling Quick Publish, it becomes a one-click setup. If you write the same type of content every day, this becomes a no brainer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3-Desk-App-Screenshot-iCloud-Local.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All articles you write can be saved to your iCloud Drive, along with anywhere else on your Mac. This is great if you start work on one Mac and finish on another (say at home and work). Your work travels with you from computer to computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-Desk-App-Screenshot-Markdown-WYSIWYG.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Desk on screen editor works in two ways: Markdown (awesome) or HTML (awesome, too.) With HTML mode off, the final formatting can be displayed in a separate preview window. If you’re good with Markdown, you’ll really enjoy writing with Desk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/5-Desk-App-Screenshot-Edit-Existing-Posts.png?w=882&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget one important feature. Desk might be just a text-centric writing application, but that doesn’t stop it from being able to edit existing posts published to your platforms. From the side menu—where you do almost everything—you can select an existing post to work on or update without ever having to launch your browser or log into an admin page on your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not have been a super in-depth look at the tool and to be honest, a deep dive wouldn’t have been necessary. Yeah, it has all the basic stuff most text editors have, but on the flip side, it’s that way on purpose. It’s not trying to be an end-all writing app for everyone. It’s not meant for screenwriters (although I’m sure you could use it for that, if you wanted… no one’s stopping you) or authors of books. Desk is meant for the Web and blogging. If you’re someone, like me, who likes to write every day and push their thoughts to a blog, this is your deal. At $30 on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk-writing-blogging-notetaking/id915839505?mt=12&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;, it’s worth every penny.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking Notes</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/taking-notes/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/taking-notes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on my journey so far, one thing I’ve noticed that seems to be most consistent is my desire to write has improved, ten fold. Instead of coming up with huge elaborate stories or long-winded essays about something I don’t even know if I completely understand, I’m starting to keep my thoughts to under a thousand words. This keeps me from getting bored with what I write, and if I do choose to write something more long-form, I can do so without feeling like that’s all I do and it’s just more words on a page. I’m also finding that I’m wanting to take time out of my day, whenever it is, to “write something real quick.” Take last weekend, for example, I wrote a total of [x] posts and published them all. Were they all related? No, but they were all things I had going on in my head and I made sure to take the time to put them down and share them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I think this is something I’ll be doing more often. This has been a product of the changes in my morning routine now that I’m writing every day, almost without fail. So far I’ve had to resort to looking at my notes but a few times, but I can only speculate if that’ll get better or worse. I have at any one time, several different things I’m pondering or thinking about and am taking note of them on my iPhone with the built-in Notes app so when I get home in the evening or start spinning up first thing in the morning, I can look back on it and pick up where I left off. There’s no shame in checking notes to remember what you might want to talk about. I have complete faith that even the best of us do that, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of things you want to talk about but don’t ever remember them, writing them down when they pop into your head could save your bacon one day!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Positioning for the Journey to Dreamland</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/sleeping-positions/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/sleeping-positions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw a rather interesting article this morning &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324595704578241642030220064&quot;&gt;via the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; that talks about finding the perfect sleep position. I couldn’t help but think: “is there some mad science in here that will give me the answer to all things sleeping so I can sleep mad sleeps and wake up feeling like a million dollars?” Well, no. The only way to wake up feeling like a stack of cash is either a) have a million dollars or b) eat some of those crazy mushrooms the kids like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324595704578241642030220064&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; had some good points that I wanted to recap because it’s something I struggle with from time to time, and after adjusting my morning routine to better serve my daily writing goals, the best sleep I can get from the limited time I have is fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on even last night’s sleep, I started out on my side, and the article puts me in the majority with 57% of sleepers starting out that way. Sometimes, if I’m already pretty relaxed, I’ll start on my back, and let my eyes literally roll back into my head (weird I know). That’s something only 17% of people seem to do, and for those stomach sleepers out there, you’re the odder of the bunch at 11% for starting positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_293&quot; style=&quot;width: 629px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-293 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2680866397_f6107a9fe0_o-1024x842.jpg?resize=629%2C517&quot; alt=&quot;2680866397_f6107a9fe0_o&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;This doesn’t seem to be a good position to sleep in, but that’s just me. Ed Yourdon; flickr.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really found interesting is just in the next paragraph, the author talks about the variance in the amount of times people toss and turn during the night: as few as three times to as many as 36. I would have no way of knowing where I fall in that category unless I videotaped myself. I’m ok not knowing that much about my sleeping habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I whole-heartedly believe it’s important to make sure I am sleeping “properly” or as close to it as I can. I try to avoid pain areas in the sense that I’ll sleep on the opposite side if I’m favoring an area or if my back hurts, I’ll try to lay as flat as I can, to keep as much tension and pressure off it as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have time—if you don’t, I think you should make time— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324595704578241642030220064&quot;&gt;go read the article form the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep is important and making sure you’re getting the most out of it is crucial to morning success. Not all of us can just spring out of bed before the birds.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hunting the Hunter: Trying to Take a Photo of my Cat</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/hunting-cats/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/hunting-cats</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried something interesting, yesterday. Every once in a while, I find the urge to pull out my camera and shoot stuff at home. It doesn’t happen very often, and for good reason. My space is outside, where things don’t move, where all I have to worry about is what time the sun sets, and how cold my fingers will end up at the end. The outdoors is peaceful. Nature doesn’t have a schedule and it largely sticks around for as long as it deems necessary. There are great places to hike, camp, and smell the roses, if there are any. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing it back into reality, however, my home isn’t anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried taking a photo of you cat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did, and it wasn’t easy. It took a bit of thinking, stealth maneuvering, and patience. See, cats are these interesting creatures that do whatever the heck they want, when they want. They’re the part of nature that waits for no one, and if you miss out, that sucks for you. It’s interesting to see the juxtaposition of an animal that’s an extension of our larger feline friends in the wild, so free-spirited, and they end up pooping in some baking-soda-covered clay chunks, and they’re totally ok with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe your cat’s chill. Good for you. Maybe you don’t own a cat and think I’m totally whack even talking about it, not long after talking about my cat being in a box. You might be wondering if I’ve run out of ideas of things to write about. All of those thoughts are valid and I understand your concern. I’m not crazy, though. Never the crazy cat person, will I be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you might be wondering if I ever got that photo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cat 1. Human 0.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On the Bus in the Fog Unlike a Dog on a Log in a Bog with Nog</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/bus-fog/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/26/bus-fog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I’ve tried to write a post on the bus. There’s a lot of free time to be had on the bus, that I could just waste reading ArsTechnica articles or scrolling Facebook. But after my recap on the finicky &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/268/give-it-up&quot;&gt;relationship I have with my iPhone&lt;/a&gt; I feel like it’s necessary to look into putting it to better use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, let me be clear. I don’t have any special writing apps to craft posts for when I’m in a bus in the fog writing for my blog (or any other alliterative, Dr. Seuss-type wordplays). I’m using the basic Notes app that comes with all Apple devices these days. I’m not even bothering to check my spelling too much as autocorrect seems to be doing a pretty good job on its own. Now granted if my word choice ends up being a total crapfest, then I feel like I need to go back and update it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the Notes app comes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://WordPress by Automattic https://appsto.re/us/i9Mau.i&quot;&gt;WordPress app from Automattic&lt;/a&gt;. It’s how I interface with my site from both my iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I don’t find it necessary to spend every waking moment writing, although it is enjoyable. I’m sure if I tried hard enough I could find enough stuff to talk about during the day to write non stop for two people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, what’s a blog post anyway but a digital journal entry? All I’m doing is putting my thoughts on digital paper and sharing them. I understand the recourse of the idea that once it’s on the Internet it’s there forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, someone will want to sit next to me and hopefully I’ll be close to the end. There’s nothing I hate more than someone peeking over my shoulder trying to see what I’m up to. I get passing glances and whatnot, stuff happens. I can’t expect someone to never catch a glance of my kickass high score in Candy Crush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to clear my autocorrect dictionary after all the new crap words it seems to have recorded after I wrote this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I might have seemed a bit ramble. That’s just how I write and think on a moments notice. I wrote this post more so to prove a point that to myself that I can write wherever I am. In the future, I think I’ll have to procure one of those keyboard iPad cases. A small screen makes my thumbs hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently caught a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux1GxExRUUY&quot;&gt;TED Talk by Rainer Strack&lt;/a&gt; on the shifting of the workforce in the few decades to come. There’s a fundamental change that’ll take place soon and one thing’s for sure, there’ll end up being a lot more vacancies in the job market than there are now. I’m sure you’re wondering: [Conservative] How can this be? Isn’t the economy in the toilet, still? [Progressive] How can this be? Isn’t the economy doing great already? Well fear not pundit! Because neither really matter. See, it’s not about how the economy’s doing but who’s working. In the 50s, we had what you’d call a “boom.” It wasn’t an industrial boom, nor an oil boom. It was a baby boom. While it sounds all fine and dandy, the problem lies in what will happen when that sharp population growth that took place fifty and almost sixty years ago all of a sudden decides to retire. I’m sure you can figure out the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Never Gonna Give You Up, Never Gonna Put You Down&#8230; Sometimes.</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/25/give-it-up/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-25T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/25/give-it-up</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As much as I try to stay current with technology, there’s a part of me that just doesn’t care if I check my phone all the time, or am constantly reading emails on the weekend. I know a lot of people keep up to date on the latest everything with every device they have and that’s awesome. I just can’t do that. However, there’s one device that I really can’t live without because it’s become a gateway to the “Quick-Check-to-See-if-the-World-Has-Burned-Down” reality: my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m quite sure the list of people that say they couldn’t live without their phone is staggering. Hell, Instagram is a phone-only thing and look at how many people share what they’re eating on regular basis! If people stopped caring so much about their phones and making sure everything that was going on was going through their phone, Instagram would shut down. It’s likely that twitter would take a big hit, too. Facebook… meh. People are still butthurt about the unbundling of services that Facebook did recently, because they don’t have anything else to be upset about. They’re rebelling against the system by using their browser or their computer as if that’ll do anything. You go guys… way to stick it to the man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I love having my phone around with me all the time, but it’s more of a just-in-case-something-happens kind of need. I might be listening to podcasts while I travel to and from work every day, but we’ve been able to do that for quite some time, before smartphones were a thing (remember the iPod?) so that doesn’t count as a dire need. I listen to music, too, but that also falls under what I just described. I might check twitter every now and then or watch Facebook all morning but that just drains me. Have you ever sat on twitter reading people’s 140-character-or-less thoughts and NOT felt drained or depressed afterwards? The world sucks nuts and I can only read about it for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world used to be a simpler place. Cats used to sit inside cannons like it’s no big deal. You can tell a lot about a time period by whether you have a cat that’s willing to loiter around artillery. Those days were nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_267&quot; style=&quot;width: 629px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tumblr_neyf5bef5V1sfie3io1_1280.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-267 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tumblr_neyf5bef5V1sfie3io1_1280-1024x642.jpg?resize=629%2C394&quot; alt=&quot;tumblr_neyf5bef5V1sfie3io1_1280.jpg&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;See!? A Cat. In a Cannon. What, did you think I made that up?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all I don’t use my iPhone for, though, if I didn’t have it with me, I’d feel disconnected, I’ll admit. It’s become more of a security blanket when I’m moving between point A and point B. I, and likely society as a whole, have been trained to think that if I leave my house without my phone, something bad might happen and I won’t be able to call for help! I wonder how people in the 90s even survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if I absolutely had to, could resort to a dumb phone. Apple still makes iPods, so all my smart tools could just migrate to that device. I’d have iMessage wherever I had wifi and text messaging on my dumb phone. Turns out, though, that I’d still end up paying an arm and a leg for service. The difference of $20 for data isn’t worth the downgrade. On the flip side, the uncharge of $20 for data to have a smartphone is paltry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one day I’ll see if I can go a whole day without my smartphone. I have a ton of technology around me at home, and a ton more at work, so really there’ll only be roughly three hours out of the day where I’m in that disconnected state that won’t allow me to get the latest tweets that I hate or read emails the bleeding freaking second they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Recap of the #10DaysBetterBlog Challenge</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/25/blog-challenge-recap/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-25T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/25/blog-challenge-recap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finished the Ten Days to a Better Blog (a.k.a. #10DaysBetterBlog) challenge a couple weeks ago and ever since, I just can’t stop writing! I knew I had it in me, but it took signing up for something and actually committing to it in order for me to realize I could actually find the time to put words down and express what’s in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a kind recap from the posts from a couple weeks ago, here’s the ten days, broken down by day. If you’d rather see them all listed out as posts, you can do so  &lt;a href=&quot;/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=73&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; title=&quot;Edit “Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?”&quot;&gt;Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife told me something quite hilarious this afternoon. She said she saw a woman wear Ugg boots to an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=141&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; title=&quot;Edit “Why I Write”&quot;&gt;Why I Write&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this newfound journey I’m on to blog better is to look inward at myself and try to figure out why I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=143&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; title=&quot;Edit “The Space in Which I Craft”&quot;&gt;The Space in Which I Craft&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve come to learn is that having a good writing space is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 4:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=150&amp;amp;action=edit&quot; title=&quot;Edit “Reflection”&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while it’s a good idea to just take some time and reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 5: &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/163/half&quot; title=&quot;Half-Way There&quot;&gt;Half-Way There&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks my half-way point on my  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;#10DaysBetterBlog&lt;/a&gt; journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 6: &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/180/about&quot; title=&quot;New About Page&quot;&gt;New About Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to stick to my routine this morning and sat down to craft my About page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 7: &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/191/analytics&quot; title=&quot;Analytics&quot;&gt;Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, I’m doing the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;#10DaysBetterBlog&lt;/a&gt; challenge as a starting point to build up my blog…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 8:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart&quot; title=&quot;Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year&quot;&gt;Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still with me, I’m on day eight of the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;#10DaysBetterBlog&lt;/a&gt;challenge/workshop/event put on by  &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do/&quot;&gt;John Saddingto&lt;/a&gt;n of  &lt;a href=&quot;http://desk.pm/&quot; title=&quot;Desk.pm&quot;&gt;Desk.pm&lt;/a&gt; fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 9:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/209/coffee&quot; title=&quot;Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)&quot;&gt;Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I ran out of coffee creamer so I hope this all makes sense, if not… meh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 10:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/215/one&quot; title=&quot;And Then There Was One – Wrapping Up and Looking Back&quot;&gt;And Then There Was One – Wrapping Up and Looking Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it folks, have a good evening and enjoy your week! Start it off with your best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ghostly Sharing to Twitter from Jetpack&#8217;s Publicize Plugin</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/tweeting-ghosts/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/tweeting-ghosts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A rather odd thing started happening shortly after I implemented Jetpack on this site. I was seeing my posts show up on twitter, which is nice and all, but not through the method I had set up. I describe how I set up automatic post scheduling for the various social networks in this past. These tweets were being written without a fancy permalink, which seemed odd and told me that it wasn’t something of my intentional doing. After doing some research, I discovered someone having an issue with the Publicize plugin not removing a social media account properly. In order to fix their issue, they re-added their account and removed it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured it would be a stretch but I knew it couldn’t hurt anything so I tried that myself just to see what would happen. I Added my Facebook page, and after authorization, lo and behold, my twitter account showed up, too. It wasn’t previously authorized so I had a pretty good idea this ghost authorization was what was causing these unwanted shares. Un-linking my twitter account immediately solved the problem, and I was on my way to sharing the way I want to: WordPress &amp;gt; IFTTT &amp;gt; Buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Set up Automatic WordPress Blog Post Scheduling with IFT.TT, and Buffer</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/ifttt-buffer/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/ifttt-buffer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest. The year is 2015 and nobody wants to do things by hand or manually if they can help it. Companies are hiring people to automate the hell out of everything because like M.I.A (sort of, not really) &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.jlyman.net/1JnTw3K&quot;&gt;famously rapped&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;live fast, die young, robots do it well.&lt;/em&gt;“I’ll admit, I like speeding up the process of sharing what I’ve written but I like controlling it a bit more than some. Here’s how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to create an account with &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.jlyman.net/1Cpvd3e&quot; title=&quot;IFTTT&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bufferapp.com&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t already. IFTTT stands for &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; his, &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; hen &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; hat. The premise is that you can take data being expelled from one service, and based on certain criteria, do something with it via another. Things like “Text me with the daily weather report at 5AM” are easy and, well, kind of cheesy. If you become a power user of IFT.TT or already are, you’ll know that there’s so much more you can do with the service like auto-tweet breaking news stories from news sources or trigger your Philips Hue home lighting to change color when a storm warning comes into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I want to sync IFTTT with my WordPress install. To start, I’ll need to create a new recipe and click on the blue &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; link (A) and choose the WordPress trigger channel (B). This will be the source for the data that IFTT uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt_step1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt_step1-1024x640.jpg?resize=629%2C393&quot; alt=&quot;ifttt_step1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I have that set, I can choose whether I want this action to be triggered by any new post from WordPress, or just when the post has a particular tag or category. In my case, I choose the former, because I want to share all posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.48.33.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.48.33.png?resize=629%2C243&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.48.33&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can skip Step 3 as there’s nothing else to set for these triggers and move on to step four. Click Create Trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at this point we’ve established that if there’s any new post on WordPress Blog then we’ll do something. Now we establish what that something is. Click the blue _that _link. In my case, I want to share to Buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.36.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.29.png?resize=627%2C199&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.51.29&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.36.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.51.36.png?resize=627%2C262&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.51.36&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will want to choose the “Add to Buffer” option since I won’t be pushing photos from my source. My final step is to set up how I want my shares to look and then I create my action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If this is your first time, you’ll have to set up what account you want Buffer to schedule this IFTTT-pushed content on. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.53.36.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-24-20.53.36.png?resize=627%2C308&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-01-24 20.53.36&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple things to keep in mind when setting this up. Anything pushed from IFTTT to Buffer: 1) will be set to whatever schedules you have created and 2), will only be pushed to whatever social media account you have set up for this channel. You can only have one social media account chosen for this type of setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use more than just one social media account to share you content, I recommend creating separate recipes for each. Granted, only one of them will be scheduled via Buffer, so keep that in mind. In my situation, I don’t really mind, and I use Buffer so much already that I like having the ability to manually schedule for other social media accounts that don’t get as much regular pushing of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-done&quot;&gt;All Done!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s that simple. If you have account with IFTTT and Buffer already set up, this will take you thirty seconds to do. You’ll find this thirty seconds will save you time in the long run and will become something that you don’t even think about at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure you could use WordPress plugins, too, and that’s all fine and dandy. I’m not stopping you! This is how I like to do it and I figured someone out there might like to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for stopping by, have a good one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Looking Ahead to February</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/for-february/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/for-february</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I missed writing yesterday, for the first time in almost three weeks but I had good reason. I was testing out an alarm clock app on my iPhone that plays gentle sounds that are supposed to gradually wake you. I thought this would be a great idea as I’m all about waking up to something less than an apocalypse coming from a bedside table. I promise this is going somewhere and is related to what I eventually want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night I tried this app, it didn’t work. Turns out, it’s useless when you blatantly lock the phone. The notifications it throws are also useless in alerting you that it’s time to wake if you use the night-time privacy setting, like I do. After the first morning, all I got were a bunch of notifications that meant nothing to me anymore and was instead awoken by my wife, who just happened to be awake at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second night, I did a bit of poking around and found out that an app cannot play sounds while the phone is locked without user intervention. This is why I can play music and sounds all day so long as I tap a play button but an alarm clock app cannot automatically start making music. The workaround for my new alarm clock app friend is to leave the screen open, don’t let it lock, and just darken it after X minutes passes. That’s all find and dandy. The first few minutes the screen was on didn’t bother me as the screen was technically pretty dark to begin with; the UI elements weren’t bright at all, likely by design for night usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come morning, however, this is where I realized I need a bit more push than gentle sounds to wake me up. I set my alarm for 3:30am to start making noise and work its way through sounds that get louder and more abrasive. Turns out, that did very little. It took two hours for me to notice my alarm was going off, a.k.a. 5:30am. Most days, I would be walking out the door at that point. With a small change of plans, I started rushing through my morning and I started remembering exactly why I get up earlier. Having the extra time to spin up every morning is much nicer and feels much better than getting more sleep. I’d trade an hour and a half of sleep for an hour and a half of time I can be productive, any day, so long as it’s in the morning. I’m not so much a fan of staying up late at night because by around 8pm, I’m pretty tired and staying up later doesn’t yield much productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, back to my original topic of discussion. Because I missed my alarm, that was apparently going off for two hours like it was no big deal, I missed a writing session. I would have been writing from 4:15 to 5:15 or so and my creative juices would have been flowing. I told myself it was going to be all right and I was still meeting &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart&quot; title=&quot;Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year&quot;&gt;my goals for writing&lt;/a&gt; something substantial at least twice a week. However, it got me thinking about expanding that idea and having two substantial posts and a few more minor posts talking about smaller topics. Here’s where we get into plans for February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say I don’t write enough isn’t quite accurate. I think at this point in time, based on recent history—three weeks—I’m writing plenty, that’s not the modification to my goal. What I want to start enforcing with myself is that I write every day of the week, no matter what and no matter how short or long the posts are, so long as I have two substantial posts per week. This plays on my old goals and gives me something to fill in for the remaining days of the week. I was thinking to myself just this morning that I could skip writing today because I’m still meeting my goals, but I really don’t want to skip writing. I enjoy writing. I enjoy telling a story about something that happened to me. I like sharing an experience. I like giving a tutorial or sharing instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be it. Every day, I’m writing more. March, I’ll up the ante, again in a small way—so as to not over-burden myself and end up quitting—and so on. Starting with February, I’m sticking to a daily writing routine with two days of substantial content and five days of shorter topics, minimum. I won’t stop myself from putting down three thousand words on a subject if I feel like it, I just won’t require it (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I&#8217;m Sorry, I Have Commitment Issues</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/commitment-issues/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/24/commitment-issues</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hope the title drew you in a bit because unfortunately I’m not talking about anything super juicy. I do a lot of different things here and there that relate to my career in the IT field as well as activities that have zero to do with it. I’ll admit, I enjoy my job and the new challenges it brings, but sometimes, at the end of the day, I just want to see someone else play video games. Other days, I want to keep my options open &lt;a href=&quot;http://jlymanphotography.net&quot;&gt;go photograph a sunset&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn’t make me a bad person, it just makes me easy to distract. Fortunately, I don’t have that problem with my personal relationships, or I’m sure my wife would kill me. Moving on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that I don’t have a huge list of hobbies for good reason. If I did, I wouldn’t ever finish any of them. I have a few things I really enjoy and I tend to stick with them. These things include photography, writing, web design, and gaming. I’m going to break these down into their own parts and describe what about them is important to me and why, at times, it takes precedence over everything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;photography&quot;&gt;﻿Photography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a hobby, I believe it to be the most serious one, as it is the one I have sunk the most money into. I have yet to turn a profit, and part of that is intentional. I really enjoy making photographs, but I do not have the time to make it a full-time job, yet. Perhaps someday in the future, I will be able to live off of print sales, but the odds are not in my favor and I would rather not bet against the house on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I kept telling myself I would spend more time making photographs than I did the year prior. While that statement has mostly been hot air, there has been some truth to it. I have created more quality photos in 2014 than I did in 2013, and 2015 is already starting off on the right foot, with more quality photos made than in the same month a year prior. I believe the trend will continue, so long as I do not find myself getting caught up in everything else, which might happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put photography first on my list because it is the hobby I see myself sticking with the longest. It allows me to get out and adventure more than anything else I do, mainly because everything else I do is a largely stationary activity. One does not frag noobs in the forest. The biggest hurdle and detractor from making this hobby an even more serious part of my life is motivation. In 2014, I visited places I had never seen before, and likely would have never visited. It gave me an excuse to up to the mountains and stand around looking at nature. I don’t know many people who willy-nilly drive almost three hours each way to stand around. I’m sure most people would extrapolate that a bit and call it hiking; I’m not much of a hiker if I don’t have my camera. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, big life changes are coming my way and that has and will continue to be my motivation to get out more and shoot while I still can. My wife and I won’t likely be coming back to the Seattle area for at least five years, maybe six or seven. That’s a long time to be away from great locations to shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With writing, I don’t have a problem actually doing it. I really enjoy it. In fact, this particular post is my fourth for the day. It’s a great way to kill time and stimulate my mind simultaneously. It’s better than playing video games and watching TV. It’s not as stimulating as photography, however, but it’s not very warm outside right now. If we were currently in the summer season, I might be sitting outside or at least with the window open, getting some natural air and light exposure. Right now, it’s dark and bleh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My largest hurdle with writing is motivation, just like photography. It’s easy to say that I’ll do it later or I’d rather play video games because I’m tired of typing. In reality, typing is just a thing, like breathing, that happens when I write. I can type for hours if I have something to type. ﻿Once I get the spark that ignites my internal writing engine, I can hammer out a college paper in a few hours or a story on cheap taxidermy in no time at all, without even thinking about it. My mind just flows and whatever is up next gets put onto the digital paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lack of commitment to writing is already actively being addressed via several angles. First, I formally started up this blog by taking the Ten Days to a Better Blog challenge (also referred to as #10DaysBetterBlog). It was a simple challenge/workshop that involved writing for ten days straight and in the meantime, working out the kinks that prevent you from being able to write consistently and making realistic goals for yourself to build up your writing lifestyle. It didn’t have anything to do with writing styles, topics, or anything of the sort. Search Engine Optimization wasn’t a part of it, either. The idea was solely that no matter what, you should never not write. Writing is a great way to voice opinions, ideas, thoughts, and help others. Even if the topics are seemingly random, it still helps in two ways by helping you learn to write more and get used to the idea of putting your ideas and thoughts on digital (or even regular) paper and the possibility that someone might stumble upon something you wrote at one time and it ends up helping them with whatever issue they were having that may or may not have been related to what you were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One I stated getting into the workshop, I started changing my morning routine, too. I now wake up 90 minutes earlier every day so I can take time and write. It gets me going in the morning and gets me thinking about something worthwhile. I find that self-discovery and reflection is a great thing to do in the morning. Plus, I’ve gotten used to sleeping a more consistent schedule so I’m not always so groggy in the morning. Before I hacked my morning routine, I felt rushed and grumpy every morning as I was heading into work. I didn’t feel useful or productive until well into mid-morning, and it was starting to piss me off. I really can thank the #10DaysBetterBlog challenge/workshop for the assist in getting my morning crap worked out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-design&quot;&gt;Web Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like working with the Web. To say I’m a designer isn’t really true in the strict sense of it, but I think it still technically fits. I’m always working on a new way to display my site and am constantly tweaking it. Would something like that land me a job doing it full time? Probably not. Typically companies are looking for more than just someone who likes tweaking with their web server settings every now and then after discovering some crazy new tool or script that does this one thing that no one will ever know about and may not actually be useful in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the time on purpose to build up this site from scratch. I built the server, installed the proper software, configured it, installed and configured WordPress, and more, all on my own, all intentionally. It’s stuff I like to do. I’m sure there are a lot of different ways to go about doing what I just described and there are many different series that do that for you because frankly some people just don’t have the time to tweak and screw with stuff to get it to work. If I felt that way, I’d be all over those services, too. ﻿I like to think that learning more about how the inner workings of a web server actually function would help me in my career. I don’t do it just for giggles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I want to work on for 2015 is taking the time to deep dive into a particular technology and understand it fully. For example, I know what Memcached is, and I could get it running with reference material, but that’s it. If I wanted to excel in that tech, I’d need to know it inside and out and really understand how it works and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Same goes for a lot of services tech companies use these days like NodeJS, Cassandra, Hadoop, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gaming&quot;&gt;Gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had this idea in the back of my head that one day I’ll be able to play video games professionally. I see people on YouTube who do it and do it well and they make loads of cash. Granted they’ve spent a vast amount of time getting to where they are now. I don’t know if I’d ever be able to make it that far with everything else I have going on and with the fact that at times, I’ll go a few months without playing more than a couple hours worth of video games. At my current pace, I’ll become a pro gamer in the year 2150. Good thing I bought a Turtle Beach Major League Gaming-branded headset to shout into when I’m playing Destiny and smoking fools. ﻿&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any desire to change the level of commitment I have to this hobby. It’s a great distraction when I don’t want to think about much and would rather veg and checkout from reality for a bit. I can totally understand why some people play games non stop. There’s a whole different world in each game that doesn’t involve anything remotely like being yourself. You really could be anybody and that’s kind of creepy but cool at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-the-end-of-the-day&quot;&gt;At the End of the Day…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not that bad. I’m sorry I don’t spend enough time with you. I understand your needs are important but to be honest, my needs are, too. Sometimes they change a bit. Don’t think I forget about you, though. I never forget, which is why I keep coming back. Just don’t expect me to constantly pay attention to you. ﻿I enjoy keeping it fresh. We’ll go on that hike soon and I’m sure we’ll have some great views and come back with some awesome memories. Likewise, I’m sure I’ll get around to that book I’ve always been meaning to write with you.Don’t forget I bought you that pass so we could spend more time together making fools out of our enemies. I got that because I knew we could enjoy it together, I just wasn’t expecting you to want that all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Scared to Act</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/22/scared-to-act/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-22T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/22/scared-to-act</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one will be short, today. My wife and I are seeing changes blowing in the wind and the storm is certainly on its way. We’re moving to the great, sunny, state of California, more specifically, to the Bay Area. We’re excited and scared at the same time. From my point of view, my career will be taking a left turn into something greater, for sure, but that means more pressure to perform from me. On the flip side, I can also better my skills as a photographer, there, too, with all sorts of new locations and opportunities to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a difficult thing to pick up and move roughly a thousand miles away from where you grew up, but I know it’s worth it. The worst thing either of us could do is be too scared to act. I’d hate to see a potential opportunity for success be thrown away because we didn’t take the leap. Starting a new chapter in our lives is great. Starting it somewhere new for both of us is even better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>There Are Some Things Money Can&#8217;t Buy&#8211;For Everything Else, There&#8217;s a Cat in a Box.</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/21/cat-box/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/21/cat-box</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder about cats. Who invented them? Why are they here? Are those whiskers really just antennae they use to communicate with their alien space ships? All these things are valid questions if you are like me, because obviously my brain isn’t stimulated enough as it is. Of all cat-related questions out there, the one that keeps me the most interested and stumped is: what’s with the boxlust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s a word I just came up with. Boxlust. Noun. The unreasonable and indescribable urge to be in, on, or around boxes as much as possible, for particular reason. I’ve witnessed my cat enjoy cardboard boxes like none other. Even as a kid, I enjoyed boxes, but not to the extent my feline friend does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that got me wondering: perhaps someone’s looked into this already! I look to the ever trusting Internet to find out the who, what, where, why, and how of cats and their desires for cardboard containers with eight right-angled corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I came up with was a quote from Stephen Zawistowski from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals (ASPCA). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/why-do-cats-like-boxes-2013-6&quot;&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt; “Cats like boxes because they are cryptic animals; they like to hide…[it] gives them a place of safety and security.” That explains a lot. When my cat enters his corrugated fortress, I’ll find he’s dug a mote around his encampment and at some point in the day found alligators to fill it. I’m still trying to figure out where he was able to procure alligators, as I can’t even seem to procure the right kind of accessories for my Playstation 4 on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live Science &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livescience.com/45461-why-do-cats-like-boxes.html&quot;&gt;tells us&lt;/a&gt; that seeking out confined spaces is an instinctual behavior for cats. That makes sense, just like it’s an instinctual behavior for me to seek out a couch to veg on all weekend, every weekend. It’s a fire that burns deep in my core, and I suspect my cat lusts after the four-walled brown structure of an Amazon.com shipping box like a heroin addict lusts after crank: with the burning intensity of a thousand suns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this all sounds like good information, I wasn’t satisfied with such normal and structured answers, so I took to reddit because why not? if the Internet has something to say about something, they’ll be saying it on reddit. Reddit User &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2fjma4/eli5_why_do_cats_like_boxes/ck9x5j7&quot;&gt;OookOok says&lt;/a&gt; it has something to do with trees, wood pulp, and the similarity. I’m trying to think of what wild cat fits &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; a tree and can’t seem to come up with anything. Oh well, perhaps I’m missing a crucial demographic of the wild cat species: the one that’s like my house cat but somehow feral or wild? I didn’t know that was such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I got to thinking: in my obviously non-scientific accidental experiments, our cat seems to enjoy sitting on paper more than anything else. If my cat knew how to pay the child came “Hot Lava,” he’s a freaking expert. I feel like if my carpet ever became poisonous, he’d survive longer than I would. Perhaps he’s giving his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2fjma4/eli5_why_do_cats_like_boxes/cka5hvk&quot;&gt;kitty stamp of approval&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason is, I find it incredibly amusing. I’ve given up on buying cat trees, beds, houses, or other expensive toys. He’s resorted to several $1 rattling mice, pens, and paper products. I really should see if Staples is selling cat toys now. I feel like they’d have a great new product line and niche covered in a heartbeat. Either that or just get him a job with UPS. All those boxes? Yeah, he’d dig that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Extending My Writing Goals to Photography</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/20/photography-goals/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/20/photography-goals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I’m not working, writing, or studying, I’m (ideally) shooting. I’m a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jlymanphotography.net&quot;&gt;landscape photographer&lt;/a&gt; and by shooting I mean “taking photos of.” One of the things I struggled with in 2014 was my motivation to shoot more. I’ve always had a small inkling in the back of my mind that I’d like to live out a career at my desk writing and taking photos. With my start to writing underway (and so far going relatively smoothly), the next half of that is creating more photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of photographers will tell you that the gear doesn’t make the photographer. While I find that to be true, the gear does make the photographer more motivated if the gear they just bought is exponentially better than what they used to own. See, up until the end of last year, I owned a four year old camera body—the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_60d&quot;&gt;Canon 60D&lt;/a&gt;—and a couple of lenses. Unfortunately, the 60D wasn’t the best for landscape photography for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor&quot;&gt;Crop-Sensor&lt;/a&gt;: While create for getting extra range when using a telephoto lens, the smaller sensor leads to more noise on the image because each individual pixel is much smaller. This became unbearable at a larger print sizes, which I love doing. I have a 30×20” photo in my dining room I took at Mt. Rainier that I would love to re-shoot with my new equipment. I know I’d get much better results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Lens Selection: While I could pick out awesome, expensive glass, it wouldn’t be worth it. With a crop sensor body, I’d have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor&quot;&gt;multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6&lt;/a&gt;, which takes an amazing landscape photography lens such as the Canon 16-35mm and turns it into a 25.6-56mm lens. While that sounds nice, that’s a bit too narrow for me. So I settled with a 3rd-party brand lens that gave me 10-20mm of range, which equated to 16-36mm, exactly where I wanted, but with a trade-off. It wasn’t super sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those two elements combined, I had a setup that I didn’t really appreciate so I stopped using it a lot. When I had the opportunity to replace my gear, I jumped on the idea, and ordered a new body—the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_6d&quot;&gt;Canon 6D&lt;/a&gt;—and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_16_35mm_f_4l_is_usm&quot;&gt;Canon 16-35mm F/4 lens&lt;/a&gt;. For what I want to shoot, it’s an amazing combination and so far I’ve had nothing but awesome luck and experiences with the combination. The setup is light and agile but not flimsy. The field of view is spectacular and the quality of imagery on the sharpness and clarity fronts are epic. Well worth the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who say that new gear won’t help you take better photos, they might be wrong if the old gear was of retiring age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to actually taking photos, however, there’s no amount of gear that will make me get out and shoot. I have to want to. With the gear half of my desire out of the way, all I have left is myself to fight with. For 2015, I’m attempting to apply the &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart&quot; title=&quot;Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year&quot;&gt;same goals I set up for my writing&lt;/a&gt; to my photography and have broken them down as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Shoot at least twice a week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Different locations each time, not coming back for at least a month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Share at least one image from each shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Stay at the location for as long as I deem necessary so as to not feel rushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Start taking my camera more places, intentionally, in case an opportunity appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are rougher goals and guidelines than what I established for my wordsmith self, and that’s ok. I have a running list of places I want to shoot and each location requires different coordination in terms of time of day, weather, how long I’m there, how long it takes to get to my final destination, etc. I can’t reasonably expect it to take an hour to shoot at a beach at sunset and take the same amount of time while I hike two miles each way to a waterfall while raining. That’s unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of my shooting will end up on the weekends, as during the week, I am working a day job so my possible options will typically be limited to sunsets and night-time photography such as shooting the stars. I’m all right with that. I shoot over the weekend while I was in California and got some great photos. After work yesterday, I ran out and shot a sunset at the beach and got more great photos. I could have just as easily stayed home after work because I was certainly tired, but I knew that it wouldn’t take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; long, and I really just need to do it and stop complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I ever want to make this something I do more regularly and possibly make money from, I need to work at it more. Same with writing. If I ever want to make something of it, I need to keep at it. No one becomes famous overnight (unless you go viral on the Internet, but even then that’s not really fame).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My First Smartphone</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/19/first-smartphone/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/19/first-smartphone</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all remember our first smartphones, for the most part. I know I remember my transition from the small brick phones that weighed as much as small bricks. They did the job back then. In 2003, texting was a limited thing still in my world and around all of my friends. We mostly emailed and instant-messaged each other. I think I did that pretty much all through high school. When I started using MySpace regularly, I communicated a lot through that service with my friends. Facebook, same story. It wasn’t until I bought my first smart phone in 2010 that my communication world really changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my first flip phone, it was in 2007. I signed up with Verizon Wireless and felt super accomplished. I also had just turned 18 so I was allowed to sign up for stuff all by myself! I felt so accomplished. I even still remember my phone number from that time! I thoguht my phone was the coolest thing in the world. It had music playback capability, a front screen with music controls on it, I could browse the Internet with the built-in WAP browser… that was the life, for sure. Back then, battery life was awesome, too. I could go a couple days without charge while still using it regularly. I made a habit of plugging in nightly, though, as charging cables were still proprietary and good quality connectors were hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first flip phone was the LG Chocolate III. It was bigger than most flip phones of the time, and I loved that. It was shiny, had a great looking screen( for a flip phone) and the interface made it feel expensive. Since this was my first phone that had more than one color on the screen, I didn’t care about things like interface speed, lag, ux, or anything of the sort. It’s likely that a lot of people felt the same way. I rocked this phone for until my next upgrade date, which came 20 months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got my first taste of what adulthood brought in terms of mobile telephony, I wanted to kick it up a notch. The iPhone was still a really new thing and the iPhone 3G was out, but was an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive. I didn’t want to switch nor did I have the money to shell out for a true smartphone (yet). I bought the LG Dare. With its 240x400px screen, I felt like I was living the high life. Bluetooth, HTML Web browsing, MP3 and AAC support… ahh the features! The Dare (VX9700) was my first entry into touch-screen space and I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the size to my current iPhone 5, the Dare was shorter (4.87 vs 4.1 inches), slightly narrower (2.31 vs 2.2 inches), and thicker (0.3 vs 0.5 inches). It’s amazing to think about how far display technology has come where you have a deivce like the Dare with 0.08mp of screen resolution at 152ppi over a three inch screen versus the iPhone 5’s 0.72mp screen at 326ppi over four inches. Talk about a jump in resolution!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When 2010 came, I finally landed my first real smart phone. By this time, the iPhone was still an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive and I didn’t want to pay more money for the same measured service. I didn’t care about what one carrier had over the other. All I cared about was the fact that I would have to shell out more dollars for the same offering; that didn’t sound like a good investment, to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of landing the iPhone, which wasn’t all bad as I wasn’t a fan of Apple products beyond the black iPod Nano I had at the time, I picked up the Motorola Droid X. When it arrived via FedEx, I was beyond excited. This was my first phone I could do complicated stuff with. It had a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; browser, not some wimpy WAP-based turd. It had apps, too! The concept of Apps blew my mind and my views on my mobile device would never be the same. It had a huge—for its time—4.3” touch screen. With a 480×854 resolution, it was at the top of the smart phone display game, second to the iPhone, of course, which still had a higher density resolution screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, though, I had no idea what that meant or why that would be significant to anybody. I was glad I had a device that was fast and had a big, beautiful display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about a year, though, I grew tired of this device. It made me feel that way, though, because at the time, Android aged quickly and updates to the software didn’t happen quick enough, if at all. The highest version one could install via traditional means was Gingerbread (2.3). It became clunky and slow and reminded me daily that it enjoyed gulping up battery juice. Even with larger capacity batteries, it didn’t take long before I got rid of it and switch to an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my battle with Android, I promised myself I wouldn’t buy another Android device, again. For the most part, I held fast to that promise. After I gave up my Droid X, my first &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; smart phone, I bought an iPhone 4S. I was thrilled to give it a shot after I heard so many good things about it from co-workers. I’ll admit it was a bit of a shock when I changed ecosystems. The whole premise was much different and I would grow to learn that was a good thing. This was my first realization that there are some devices I just want to work, no matter what. I don’t want to have to or even think about tinkering with some things, and my phone was the first on that list. It’s this idea that would eventually push me to replace my Windows PC that I hand built with a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: to this day, I still get comments like “I’d never spend 2x on a closed platform” or “way to spend much more than any of that hardware is worth!” I like to casually remind people that unlike their Windows desktop or laptop, you’ll never hear me complaining about my mac being slow or crashing. To this day I’ve only hard rebooted my mac a couple times. As of this writing, I’ve never re-installed the OS, nor have I had to have it serviced for failing parts that don’t have a definite lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, I thought I’d give the Galaxy S4 a try, as I liked the idea of the large, bright, and colorful screen. Maybe that was my downfall, just as certain insects attract their prey with bright and beautfiful colors and or the allure of something great (read: black widow) only to kill them in the end because they made a stupid decision. The Galaxy S4 started killing me shortly after I got it. I was reminded of all the reasons why I disliked android: battery life, poor resource management, too many things that need tinkering to work right. I dumped it after just a few months and went back to an iPhone, where I sit to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next phone certainly won’t be an Android device. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? Nah. Perhaps I’ll pick up an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6S (or whatever the next version is that comes out this fall). All I know is that I bought android as my first smart phone because that was what I had available to me at the time. If I had been an AT&amp;amp;T customer from the start, I may have never purchased an Android smartphone and had an iPhone from the beginning. If that was the case, I might have bought an Android device later on down the road anyway, and fought through the same battles, just in a different time frame. I can’t say for sure what would have happened, but I know that my first smart phone purchase helped shape my technology toolset as it stands now and my continued purchases will help mold my future decisions. Apple has done a good job of building up an ecosystem people don’t want to leave, and I’ll admit I am one of them. It’s comforting to know, however, that there are a lot of people like me who just want their stuff to work. If that means paying more, then so be it. Consider it a no-hassle tax.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>And Then There Was One &#8211; Wrapping Up and Looking Back</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/14/one/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-14T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/14/one</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So this is it. I signed on to the #10DaysBetterBlog challenge thinking I need to kick myself in the butt when it came to writing. I knew I wanted to do it, but I lacked motivation. I needed something that I could stick to, and work on in little pieces. Just telling myself “write more, ya dummy!” wasn’t cutting it. John Saddington’s 10 Days to a Better Blog has been the motivation I needed. I like to think of it as a personal workout regimen put together by a trainer. People &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get back into shape, but they having something there to motivate them and give them a place to start helps greatly. This was my personal training for writting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not just the action of putting words onto digital paper was affected, though. I re-started my blog. I decided to give a crap about sharing my ideas online. Sure I’ve written a couple things in the past. Back then, I kept telling myself that nobody wanted to read it so why bother? Over the last couple weeks, I learned something about that idea: it doesn’t matter how many people read it, it’s just the fact that you do it. I maybe have gotten three hundred unique sets of eyes over the last two weeks because of this challenge, and my posting links on the Desk.pm Community site. When it’s all over, I might not see any of those people again. Eleven days ago, things woudld have been different but now, I don’t care. I mean… I do care. I want to see people come to my site and read what I have to say. What I mean is that if I only get one set of eyes and those eyes belong to my wife or my mom or someone who reads my stuff in support of me, then that’s good enough. The number of eyes doesn’t effect my desire to write, anymore, and ideally it never will, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rambled a bit about where I want to go with my blogging, and set goals for myself a couple days ago. Looking back on the fact that I was able to write something and post it every day for ten days in a row is awesome. Taking the new found knoweldge I have on how much time it really doesn’t take to write something worthwhile and combining it with relfections of my goals and what I want to write about, the idea of keeping the train moving swiftly isn’t daunting. As I look back, I can say that two weeks ago me would have disagreed. I would have sighed at the idea of having to sit down and write every day, thinking that I’ll end up spending hours on something and have zero return. Nah. I get a boatload of returns each time and I don’t have to spend all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing this challenge/workshop has also helped my regular, daily routine. I discussed how I used to have a terrible morning ritual. It really wasn’t a ritual but more of a dazed panic, kind of like what happens right after you get out of your car after getting into a wreck and are losing your mind but you checked out at the same time? That’s how I used to feel every morning. That’s a terrible way to go to work and it leads to zero productivity. It used to take a couple hours to get my brain to spin up to full speed and waiting for that to happen made me even more tired. Now, I get up earlier, thanks to hacking my sleep schedule and making myself set aside time in the morning to do something stimulating like sitting down and writing. I used to think that getting up at 3:30-4:00am when I don’t have to leave until 5:30am was a joke. That’s a good 1 1/2-2 hours of sleep I could be getting. While that is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; true, it was more about when I wake up in my sleep cycle. Figuring that out and waking up more graually helped a lot more than sleeping in. I know this to be true because my weekends are still a bit sketchy. I still need to work on keeping my routine consistent on the weekends so my body can get used to it quicker. No hacks happen when you reset after five days, just to start over, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be too late to create a new year’s resoltion but I don’t really care. I think the last couple weeks has been a long crafting process for my delayed new year’s resolution. Here’s to writing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Running Out of Coffee (Creamer)</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/13/coffee/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/13/coffee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning I ran out of coffee creamer so I hope this all makes sense, if not… meh. I’m just a week into my new weekday morning routine. If you’re unfamiliar or don’t remember how I described it, it’s simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to bed around the same time every night, with &amp;lt;=30 minutes deviation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set alarm for ~4 sleep cycles (~90 minutes each) + 20 minutes ahead of when I get into bed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wake up within 30 minutes of alarm going off, allowing for a couple snoozes or time in bed with the light on to fully bring myself back to reality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Morning cleaning routine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coffee. Must have coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write. Unless something went sideways with the above steps, there should be time for this. If not, do something else stimulating enough to stay awake while consuming coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proceed with the day.
That’s the idea. Yesterday was a bit rough as I woke up at a more in-opportune time and shut off my alarm. Since my travel to work was going to be different and more forgiving this week, getting up an hour and a half late wasn’t such a big deal. I don’t want to make it a practice though, as this is the whole habit I’m trying to break: getting up at the last minute and rushing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old routine was chaotic because it left no time for deviation and frankly was frustrating. I had just enough time to do the bare minimum and that was it. No time to myself, whatsoever. After becoming more and more frustrated with it, I vowed to never do it again. I did some reading on how to “hack” my morning routine and while a load of it was crap or not useful in the least bit, the parts that stuck with me the most were about sleep cycles and morning stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleep-cycles&quot;&gt;Sleep Cycles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human’s standard sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes in length, from stage one (light sleep) to stage four (heavy/REM/dream sleep). The idea is that if whatever wakes you up in the morning does so as you’re coming out of a sleep cycle and returning to light sleep, you’ll have an easier time waking up. For the most part, that seems to be pretty true. I’ve found it just as easy to wake up when my alarm goes off at 3:30am as it does at 5:00am (provided I went to bed at 9:00pm the night before). I usually grant myself four cycles for anytime I go to bed after 9:00pm and five cycles any time I go to bed between 8:00pm and 9:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, you say… that’s only 60 minutes, a sleep cycle is 90 minutes! You’re right, it is. With the shorter cycle option, I find I have to give myself a bit of slack in the morning, by roughly 15-20 minutes. In this case, I’ll set three alarms, 15 minutes apart (ex. :00, :15, :30) and make each one more annoying than the one before it. See, I can sleep through a lot of noise in the morning hours once I’ve been through a sleep cycle or two. I’ve been tested and the doctors agreed. After one relaxes a bit in bed and has been sleeping for a bit, a lot of the stimulants and distractions from falling asleep are gone so submerging into deeper sleep is easier and more fulfilling. Thus, as deep as you go into REM sleep, it takes time to come out of it. Usually I’m aware it’s time to wake up when alarm three comes around because I seem to have trained myself to subconsciously understand that alarm one and two are warning shots that my warm, sleep-filled experience is about to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-best-part-of-waking-up-is-sometimes-not-folgers-in-your-cup&quot;&gt;The Best Part of Waking Up, Is (Sometimes Not) Folgers In Your Cup.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that most of my tiredness (or the feeling of being tired) seems to come from how and when I’m woken up in the morning in relation to my sleep cycle. I executed my five-cycle option last night and with ~7.5 hours of sleep, I feel rested. Of course, I’m wishing I had my coffee, and Starbucks will have to help me out as I drive into work this morning. A good morning stimulant isn’t always a bad thing. Some people can’t drink coffee because it’s too much caffeine and gives the anxiety or they don’t like the taste of it. I get it. I didn’t used to like coffee, either. I still don’t unless it has creamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my alternatives was Red Bull. I used to buy them by the case from a wholesale store (Costco). While roughly half the price per can as a convenience store or other local grocery chain, it was still Red Bull. It lost it’s luster after drinking one every day of the week, sometimes twice a day. Coffee is warm and creamy (after I add my creamer, of course). In the winter, this is an especially friendly feeling. In the summer, I’m more of an iced tea kind of guy. I’ll go Starbucks and get the largest, most caffeinated tea they have and have them sugar it up—I can’t stand unsweetened iced teas. Usually this is some kind of breakfast/black tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrap this post up, I’m really wishing I wasn’t out of coffee creamer. A clear oversight on my part, I knew I was out when I poured, yesterday. I know I could drink it black, but I already said I don’t like the taste of black coffee. Perhaps I’ve been ruined by sweet tastes thanks to the likes of Starbucks and other espresso-shooting vendors. Maybe I have. Sue me. I’ll pay you in Starbucks cards, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/12/smart/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-12T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/12/smart</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re still with me, I’m on day eight of the &lt;a href=&quot;/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;#10DaysBetterBlog&lt;/a&gt; challenge/workshop/event put on by &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.do&quot;&gt;John Saddingto&lt;/a&gt;n of &lt;a href=&quot;http://desk.pm&quot; title=&quot;Desk.pm&quot;&gt;Desk.pm&lt;/a&gt; fame. He’s on year 14 of blogging so chances are he knows a thing or two. Today’s topic has to do with coming up with goals in relation to where I want my blogging to go using the S.M.A.R.T. principle. It is outlined like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific&lt;/strong&gt; – target a specific area for improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable&lt;/strong&gt; – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignable&lt;/strong&gt; – specify who will do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realistic&lt;/strong&gt; – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-related&lt;/strong&gt; – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
Those seem easy enough. When placed over the idea of writing, it seemed a bit daunting at first but that’s really only because I just started doing so consistently. Here’s a breakdown of how the above translates to me and the whole idea of writing and blogging:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;specific-target-area&quot;&gt;Specific Target Area&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I can produce quality writing if I just sit down and do it. I’ve never had a problem with that. I enjoy telling stupid stories, giving slightly janky points of view on seemingly random things, and also talking about real stuff that I find important. I don’t care so much if I’m maximizing my potential audience by covering as many topics as possible, because that’s my why I’m posting this—or anything—to my site. I need to focus on actually doing. I say I’ll become a master of X subject and never actually follow through with it. I’ll say I’ll go on more hikes next year because my gut says I could lose a few. I might not be able to control those things in this scenario. I can say this: if a bear craps in the woods, then I’m writing. I’m not talking about telling a story about a bear cutting pipe. I’m talking about the assurance that words will flow out of my mind, through my hands, into my keyboard, through the bits and digital stuff inside my computer, blah blah blah, to where you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: WRITE.PERIOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measurable-progress&quot;&gt;Measurable Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first blog post since I started writing daily was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/73/ugg&quot; title=&quot;Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?&quot;&gt;January 6th, 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which as I write this, was six days ago. It’s easy for me to say that since I’ve conquered seven days, including this post, without stopping, I could bust out a whole year. Whether or not that’s true, nobody will know, because I don’t feel like it’s realistic! I’m writing every day because I made a promise to myself that I’d do this challenge and see it through to completion. I never said “I’m going to write at least 365 blog posts over the course of the year, with at least one per day, or I’ll eat my hat.” That’s stupid. Unless I worked for a publication that required articles to be created in the turn-and-burn style, I’d get maybe a month into it and burn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to make myself a little bit more seriously and treat blogging and writing as a form of genuine expression. Because of my personality, if I’ve been talking &lt;em&gt;all day&lt;/em&gt;, I tend to get bored of people and bored of talking. Just like talking, I’d get bored of writing. Why sit down at my computer and but out some words about something that I may care a grand total of zero percent about for twenty minutes when I could sit in front of my T.V. and not even have to think about using my brain. Exactly. That’s stupid. Even in school I enjoyed writing papers not because it was homework (that was quite foul), but that I was writing about a topic. I didn’t write every single damn day and I was alright with that. I hated the topic I was writing about, but I enjoyed the fact that I was writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to split up my writing adventures to a couple times a week is much more manageable because I can spend more time, perhaps over a few days, and craft a more quality piece, than some lame three hundred words on how tasty Garlic Jim’s pizza is. (side note: it’s delicious.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My measurement of progress is that I’m writing two to four pieces a calendar week, with two being the hard minimum. I need to still keep myself to a commitment, just like people commit to stop smoking. It’s hard to start, but with a hard limit like dying when it comes to smoking, having a hard limit on how few of times I sit down and put my thoughts on paper must be a thing, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assignable&quot;&gt;Assignable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s not obvious by now, this goal is mine and mine alone. No one else needs to be responsible for my writing tasks, assignments, topics, or anything of the sort. This is my beast so let me conquer it. By making this a solo task, this is something I can wholly own and have zero fear of something outside that I cannot control mucking it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;realism&quot;&gt;Realism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to this. As the popular saying goes: shit happens. It happened this morning when I twisted my ankle in the dark while walking the dog. Could I have done something about it? I don’t know, it was dark. I haven’t figured out how to turn on my night vision eyes, yet. With writing, sometimes life will get in the way and I’m completely OK with that. If I miss a week, then I’ll do my best to make up for it next week. If I know I’ll be missing a week in advance, I’ll put in extra time the previous week and schedule it out. WordPress has this fancy post-scheduling feature. While not as genuine and not as on-the-spot as some would like, I think I’m still totally genuine and real and on-the-spot. What I write down rarely gets condensed, censored, edited for time, etc. I just write. That’s always been one of my stronger traits when it came to writing; I hate outlines and I hate planning my words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secret: corporate, politically correct emails are the bane of my existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deadlines&quot;&gt;Deadlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m giving my self 1/4 year (13 weeks). If I can sit down and discuss quality topics with quality time at least twice a week, but no more than four, for 13 weeks, then I’m in business. If I make it, I’ll do it again, but add another stipulation. If I fail, I’ll pull back a bit. I think it’s doable. Given the possibility of the next six months to a year changing quite radically and a whole host of new experiences coming my way, I don’t think I’ll have an issue. I’m pretty confident I’ll have enough to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Analytics</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/11/analytics/"/>

   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/11/analytics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m cheating a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, I’m doing the &lt;a href=&quot;/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;#10DaysBetterBlog&lt;/a&gt; challenge as a starting point to build up my blog, but after I started, I realized the last day of the challenge overlapped onto a day I’m taking vacation and probably won’t be writing much, at all. So I wrote this post, along with my day 6 post. Perhaps it’t not exactly cheating but I’d rather do two in one day than miss a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I start building up this blog, one thing I want to keep track of is the content people enjoy the most and how long they enjoy it for before leaving. I’ve installed Google Analytics and am hoping I get some good data out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also include links from social networks, as I am building them with the “utm” variables in the URLs so as to accurately determine via which method people are visiting the site and reading my content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I know may be surprising is what people find most interesting. Topics, stories, and ideas I like may not resonate as well with others and they might enjoy stuff I don’t cover as often. This is what the analytics should tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site has served many purposes over the last couple of years, and none of them have really taken off. Looking back on how my routines have changed and what I am spending more time focusing on, I can really tell that at some point in the future that I can’t determine (yet), this site will finally become a permanent and consistent place for me to write and share my voice and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve always thought about doing is starting a full-on tech blog, but the work involved is greater than the amount of time I have to spend, right now. I’m sure that’ll change in the future, and when it does, I’ll revisit the idea. In the mean time, I’m content with this one property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While thinking about how my routines have changed, I know I still have a small struggle with the weekends. Over the last few days, I’ve been writing early in the morning before I leave for work and it’s been helping me start my day in a more gradual and stimulating fashion. The weekend is still a struggle though because subconsciously I know I don’t have anywhere to be in particular so why should I bother getting up early? Since hindsight is always 20/20, I can tell my 8 hour-past self that I wouldn’t feel like crap for sleeping 14 hours and my day wouldn’t be half-wasted away. I could have done a ton of stuff in the 5-7 hours I could have had as extra if I stuck to the routine I set up during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any new habit, it takes time to break out of the old one and build up a new one, so tomorrow is always another opportunity to try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my end goals with this blog is to be able to write about one particular complete topic related to the previous day. I know there are so many different things that happen all the time that I could have enough content for years, but a lot of it I don’t keep record of or even remember. I can’t remember where I read it but a statistic stated that we only remember roughly 6% of what happened the day before. Maybe that number is higher, but I also remember that within a week, that number drops to 1%. I know I can agree on the second number because this time last weekend, I remember very little of what I was doing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to just write about a random smattering of things, though. I want to keep it to topics I find interesting and relevant… stuff that describes myself and my interests, not just what I ate for breakfast, yesterday (oatmeal). It’ll take a bit of time to build up, but I’ll get there. Keeping my self writing everyday will help do that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Finding a Short Domain Based on a Name is Harder Than Ever</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/10/domain/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/10/domain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve always really enjoyed having a short address to rely upon when I tell people where to find my sites. I’m personally of the idea that the shorter you can get your address and have it still make sense, the better, especially on mobile devices. Not everyone is willing to type in myreallycoolmobileapp.com when having appname.com is much better, or even app.co, if it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the two-letter TLDs belong to countries and some have rules or restrictions on who can register with them. The ones that don’t have rules or restrictions typically still charge an arm and a leg. For example, we all know the URL shortener bit.ly. Would you believe me if I told you that the .ly TLD goes for $150 for the first year on &lt;a href=&quot;http://101domains.com&quot;&gt;101domains.com&lt;/a&gt;? Renewals are $230 for a single year. That’s a lot. There are TLDs that are much cheaper, like .co, .io, .is, .me, and whatnot, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some however aren’t…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-differences&quot;&gt;The Differences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several acronyms for the various top-level domains you see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gTLD – Generic. (.com, .net, .org, .ws)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ccTLD – Country Code. (.us, .uk, .ir, .br)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IDN – Internationalized (.中国 / .xn–fiqs8s)
## The Struggle is Real
My problem is, however, that when I want to register a short domain that uses my name with a short TLD, I’m limited on options, unless I’d like it to make zero sense. My first name is Johnathan, and that right there is too long for my tastes (hence why I currently use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jlyman.net&quot;&gt;jlyman.net&lt;/a&gt;; 6+3 is better than 9+3). I’d like to register a john.TLD domain but all the cheap ones are taken. Not surprising though, since John is an incredibly popular name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;varying-difficultly&quot;&gt;Varying Difficult.ly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of the Internet and everyone having an app, service, blog or portfolio, short addresses are harder to come by and the ones that are free will cost you. In the grand scheme of things, if I were to register a .ly address (for example), $150 a year isn’t too bad, and if I went straight to the source for the .ly TLD, I could save a lot of money. Finding “the source” wasn’t as easy as some are, however. With .ly, the country is Libya. Libya isn’t necessarily known for being the number one country for technological ease of use or freedoms. However, their NIC (Network Information Center) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nic.ly&quot;&gt;nic.ly&lt;/a&gt; provides a link to another site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ltt.ly&quot;&gt;ltt.ly&lt;/a&gt; (Libya Telecom and Technology), which gives a list of approved vendors of .ly domain names. On this list, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://LibyanSpider.com&quot;&gt;LibyanSpider.com&lt;/a&gt;, a Libyan hosting and domain name registrar. They say I can register a .ly domain for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=40+LYD&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8#rls=en&amp;amp;q=40+LYD+to+USD&quot;&gt;40 LYD&lt;/a&gt;, but since I’m an international customer, I have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://Register.ly&quot;&gt;Register.ly&lt;/a&gt;. Now four levels in, I finally find a registrar that doesn’t charge as much as 101domains. At $75, while still a serious markup (one LYD is $0.84 as I’m writing this) over the 40 LYD ($33.48 USD), it’s about as good as I’m going to get. I can’t reasonably expect to get a foreign domain name that hasn’t been completely mainstreamed by the Internet for the price of a .com or .co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-its-gone&quot;&gt;.An(d) it’s gone.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other registrar setups like this one out there for other countries, too. Some are harder to get into, like .an, which isn’t even available anymore, since the Netherlands Antilles dissolved in 2010 and became the distinct countries of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, along with three smaller still-Dutch-owned municipalities Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-just-fantasy&quot;&gt;.is This Just Fantasy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TLD .is is gaining in popularity, too, but isn’t dead easy (unless you want to pay the 101domains price). Iceland owns this TLD and can be registered directly via their NIC site at &lt;a href=&quot;http://isnic.is&quot;&gt;isnic.is&lt;/a&gt;. At roughly $36 USD, it’s not a bad price, but their site isn’t very intuitive. Sometimes, paying a bit more makes the whole process that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on for days talking about all the different gTLDs out there, but I think you’d have a lot more fun looking them all up yourself. Luckily, Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains&quot;&gt;has pretty much every TLD&lt;/a&gt; out there in one list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-gtlds&quot;&gt;New gTLDs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of newer topic-based gTLDs like .photos and .club, a lot of sites will eventually transfer over and older ccTLD and gTLD domains will &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; expire, unless a company chooses to keep renewing it and use it as a redirect. I’ve thought about having something like john.blog or jltech.blog, but I haven’t been able to make up my mind. There are a lot more options in the word-based TLD space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this’ll forever be an ongoing battle. People with short names will always have the one-up on me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reflection</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/09/reflection/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/09/reflection</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while it’s a good idea to just take some time and reflect. As I sit here with my morning coffee, on my way to hardening my new morning routine (which I first described &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnathanlyman.com/p/143/space&quot; title=&quot;The Space in Which I Craft&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I feel like the &lt;a href=&quot;/c/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;#10DaysBetterBlog&lt;/a&gt; challenge I’ve taken on has helped me to try and get into a new way of starting my morning. For example, yesterday, I tried out new music playlists on my way into work. Since I ride the bus to work, keeping my mind stimulated during the monotony is important. I’m a huge fan of classical and acoustic music when the need to focus is important. Even now, I’m listening to the “ &lt;a href=&quot;http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/0PRs1Xaui4zCv9LdIIt20X&quot;&gt;Acoustic Concentration&lt;/a&gt;” playlist on Spotify. But when it comes to my commute, it’s easy for me to get tired and want to take a nap (something I’m trying very hard to avoid) so I find playlists good for weight-lifting workouts and other high-energy music. Also, making sure I have my morning coffee is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my reflection, I’ve also been thinking about everything that I’m thankful for. My life has changed a lot in the last couple of years, and first and foremost I want to thank my wife for that. I first met her about three and a half years ago, and it’s been a crazy ride for sure, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. We got married February 2014 and I can’t see myself spending my life with anyone else. She’s always a comfort for me and being around her makes me feel so relaxed and happy. Second, I’m thankful for my parents. They’ve always supported me in anything I’ve wanted to do and are still always there whenever I need help. I try not to ask for help from my parents whenever I can avoid it because I feel at this point in my life, I should be self-sufficient; at the same time, however, I know that it’s not always a bad thing to admit you need an extra boost from someone. It may not be parents, but instead friends, or other relatives. Things happen, and it’s good to have a support system in place to help deal with life’s unexpected turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I have to talk about, today. Thanks for stopping by!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Space in Which I Craft</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/08/space/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/08/space</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve come to learn is that having a good writing space is important. For some, the room has to be just right. Darkness, music, closed doors. For others, like myself, I don’t need as much. I think it’s worth breaking down to a more manageable conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lights&quot;&gt;Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks like to keep the room dark, some like it brightly lit. I’m in between. I have a free-standing lamp from IKEA that uses two bulbs and the shades are a fogged white. The bulbs themselves are hybrid 75-watt-incandescent-20-watt-cfl. This allows the lamp to be immediately lit with bright, warm light from the incandescent bulbs while the CFLs are warming up. When they have, the bulbs automagically switch over and you notice little change. At first I thought this was awesome but I’ve come to find out that GE makes simple CFLs that don’t need any warming in 75w-equivalent sizes for roughly $7 bucks a piece. Future lights in that lamp will be of that variety, for sure. Until then, I’m content with my moderate lighting setup. It’s not too bright (like an office), which I hate, because I feel it’s distracting, and it’s not super dark, because that would put me to sleep. Plus, I feel staring at an LCD screen in the pitch dark is more traumatizing to my eyes than it’s worth, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coffee&quot;&gt;Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first post in this challenge and on my blog in particular where I wrote it before 6AM. I decided yesterday to hack my morning routine and start getting up earlier, to the more natural rhythm of my sleep cycles. I’ve almost got it down, already, just need a few more tweaks. To assist in the morning energization of my mind, a nice hot cup of coffee from my no-fuss Keurig coffee maker is a must. I don’t have time to grind and crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;music&quot;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like listening to classical music while I’m at work. It keeps me in a calm state, so I figured I’d give it a try while writing. As I write this post, I’m listing to a rather even playlist of classical music deemed for concentration on Spotify, the best $10/month investment in the world. Seriously, if you’re not in the market to spend a ton on music (classical is super cheap, anyway, so perhaps you should just go buy a few compilation albums for a couple bucks each on Amazon), Spotify is the way to go. I have so much classical music in several locations: roughly 4 days worth, end-to-end, from Amazon Music, that I spent a grand total of $6 on, a few albums from iTunes, and a half-dozen playlists on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;past-struggles&quot;&gt;Past Struggles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I’ve had bouts where I haven’t written in months, and this point of this exercise is to reflect on wether my environment is the reason for it. In my case, I’m pretty happy with where I’m sitting, in my 2nd-bedroom-turned-office. My struggle hasn’t really been with my environment, but more with my dedication to writing, and just doing it more. I get bored with things, easily, if I stop having motivation to do them, including writing. I’ve written several things in the past that I thought were really good but shortly thereafter, I stopped feeling like writing, in favor of doing other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, writing will be a part of my daily routine, no matter what I haven’t quite figured out what time of day yet, as this morning I started this at 5AM, but yesterday I started at 5:30PM. I guess so long as I’m writing every day, I can hammer out the finer points of my routine as I find a rhythm that I like. Until then, I just need to keep putting words to paper.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I Write</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/07/why/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/07/why</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of this newfound journey I’m on to blog better is to look inward at myself and try to figure out why I write. It’s more difficult than it sounds because I feel I have two thoughts that form some sort of answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a thought, maybe two.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are topics and ideas that just sound interesting. Sometimes things are utterly stupid. Certain situations make stupid stuff interesting. I like to look at writing as me telling you what I think. By reading these words, you’re telling me you have at least a small interest in what I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-money-from-blogging-is-a-fine-line-to-walk&quot;&gt;Making money from blogging is a fine line to walk.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t get rich off of blogging. People make money from ads. There’s a little part of me that hopes that some day I’ll strike it big, become famous, and my words will carry weight in the form of money bags, to the bank. I know this is a long shot and in the grand scheme of things, this is a terrible idea and hope to have as it might skew my writing. I want to be honest. Now that it’s out there, perhaps I’ll change my ways… only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you’ll excuse me, I have mashed potatoes calling my name…. get your own you damn dirty ape.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>You Really Just Would not Understand!</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that someone can explain to me why in the literal hell I would think this is something I would wear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s just a Johnathan thing. You wouldn’t understand!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you sure? At what point did I become such a pompous ass that everything I do, every action I take and word that comes out of my mouth raised to such a level that nobody on God’s green earth would understand it, even to a fraction of a degree? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least they spelled my name right… spammers have a tendency to misspell my name at least a dozen times a day, according to my spam filter. Perhaps it’s time to make a new rule to filter out those who just don’t understand: If you email me, tweet me, or otherwise try to talk to me and you don’t spell my name right, I’m going to wear this god-forsaken sweatshirt, take a photo, send it to you, tell you go pound sand, and then run away laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds crazy, right? Well it’s a Johnathan thing… you wouldn’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ugg Boots to an Interview for America?</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/06/ugg/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/06/ugg</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife told me something quite hilarious this afternoon. She said she saw a woman wear Ugg boots to an interview. Let’s stop and think about that for a moment… what is an interview, really? It’s one person asking another person questions. That seems simple enough, so who is she to judge if someone wants to wear a fashion item that was cool eight years ago to an interview? Maybe my wife was overdressed! Maybe the sky fell in somewhere and everything else this mystery lady could wear was crushed in an avalanche of space ions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it got me thinking: we hear so much garbage on TV and the radio and read online about how today’s workforce just ain’t what it used to be. I’ll mostly agree with that statement, things have changed. There are fewer people in the active workforce then there was six years ago and I’m sure that’s a bad statistic for someone somewhere planning a political event. But perhaps we’re looking at this all wrong. We’re saying people are out of work because they suck at being relevant and nobody wants to hire them anymore, when in reality, they’re just wearing those damn awful boots with the fur to interviews. I’d be willing to bet the 1.5 bitcoin that Mt. Gox owes me that if fewer people wore boots to an interview (sans those above the arctic circle, they get a pass… it’s damn cold up there and that snow… oh God that snow) we’d have more people working! I have an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take down the Ugg boot people. They’re the ones destroying America with their job-killing foot-holders! They’re so anti-American, they can’t even make a red, white, and blue colored boot! How dare they appease the socialists! Tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait… why stop at the boots? What about everything else!? We should ban computers because they don’t do enough to prevent spelling errors on resumes crafted by greasy teenagers in their parent’s basement. Those undiscovered wordsmiths are being held back by corporate America’s technological offerings. We need to bring back the #2 pencil… for America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait… again! Can you imagine the horrors if their greasy car didn’t start? What would our new-found leader of the free world do if their 1993 Honda Civic didn’t start and they had to walk to work? If they lose their job, they’ll NEVER take over this country and bring it back to its full, Ugg-boot-free glory! We must stop the crap-mobiles from continuing their journeys on the road of freedom, aka America Avenue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an idea… let’s let them wear the Ugg boots. Forget everything I just said. If you’re that much of a tool or generally ignorant that an interview for a professional job in a professional setting with other professionally-dressed people around you doesn’t give you a single hint that perhaps you should have worn something without the fur, maybe that job isn’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is the first of ten based on a new mission I’m on: 10 Days to a Better Blog from the maker of the Desk app (the best writing app to ever exist). Please follow my adventures on this blog with the tag &lt;a href=&quot;//jlyman.net/t/10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;10daysbetterblog&lt;/a&gt; and follow all who take part in this project &lt;a href=&quot;//twitter.com/#10daysbetterblog&quot; title=&quot;#10daysbetterblog&quot;&gt;on twitter with the hashtag: #10daysbetterblog&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Disabling Comments on Existing Posts After Disabling Comments Site-Wide with WordPress</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/01/wordpress-comments-bug/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/01/wordpress-comments-bug</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I can’t seem to replicate this issue anymore and thus closed out the bug I submitted below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into an issue this morning after disabling comments site-wide on this particular site that I could no longer enable the Discussion widget to disable comments on existing posts. Since this seems like an issue others would run into, I took the liberty of &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.jlyman.net/1xy9ztr&quot; title=&quot;#30880 User Cannot Disable Comments on Existing Post after Disabling Comments Site-Wide - trac.wordpress.org&quot;&gt;creating a bug against WordPress 4.1 addressing the issue&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interesting in following, feel free to do so here or via the bug itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workaround&quot;&gt;Workaround&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While clunky, my work around was to re-enable comments site-wide so as to have the Discussion widget return as an option in the Post Editor so I could disable comments for my existing posts. I cannot speak as to wether it was limited to just _published _posts as I did not test it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While some would call him a tool, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Carter&quot; title=&quot;Bob Carter&quot;&gt;Bob Carter&lt;/a&gt;‘s famous statement above rings truer than ever in my world. This post shall kick of a new series on project management faux pas. I’ll be tossing in my every so slightly jaded views and perhaps a rant or two where needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-fire-drill-is-an-emergency-preparedness-tool-not-a-pm-buzzword&quot;&gt;A Fire Drill is an Emergency Preparedness Tool, Not A PM Buzzword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a boat load of buzzwords used in the corporate workplace that make me want to punch babies. I hear quite a few of them daily and it makes me glad I don’t have kids right now. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, good for you. You haven’t been tainted by middle-management’s eternal goals of making projects as convoluted as possible while wrapping them up with sleazy-marketing-colored paper and ribbon. It’s a common occurence to hear at least one of the well-known words or phrases on the list such as synergy, vertical, circle back, or the one I absolutely hate the most: &lt;strong&gt;fire drill&lt;/strong&gt;. Any time someone says something’s a fire drill, I want to tell them “there’s no fire, go sit the fack down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, Fire Drills are products of poor planning on someone’s part, and they’re trying to cover their own ass. Everything will subsequently be an emergency and whatever you’re doing, however important it may genuinely be, will no longer be of relevance. This makes the Project Management part of me absolutely rage with hatred so hot, the Seven Circles of Hell have seen nothing like it. The effect is compounded when you don’t have any visibility into the back story or even the entire project. This is where things can get ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is this: do what you can with what you have, and that’s that. Don’t be afraid to say “no” because at some point, you as a project manager, lead, or other member of leadership in your team has to draw a line; your team is important and playing along with someone’s failure to execute will only harm your team more. When you do say “no,” also be prepared for an alternate solution. While you may want to just flip the bird and drop the mic, coherence between teams is crucial lest a company completely fall apart because teams are literally at war with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-triage-a-last-minute-project&quot;&gt;How to Triage a Last-Minute Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the scenario: you’ve arrived at the office at your normal time, and team lead Joe from the Development team at XYZ Corp (the company you work for) rushes to your desk and says they need all of your staff to drop whatever they’re doing and do A, B, and C tasks by the end of the day, then scurries back to whatever hole he came out of. You, the PM and leader of your team of elite superhumans, knows very well how quickly a project can go sideways and understands the need to make sure the pieces all fall into place in a timely fashion. Here’s where you have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically say yes without any second thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Say No with an asterisk (a.k.a: “I need more information”).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Say No and give a reason.
Let’s cover those three options in detail and determine which will create what outcome, starting with the worst-possible choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automatically-say-yes-without-any-second-thoughts&quot;&gt;Automatically Say Yes Without Any Second Thoughts.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three, this is the worst idea and here’s why: you just arrived. You have no idea what the status of your own team, is, yet. How on God’s green earth can you assume you can pull a rabbit out of your hat if you don’t even know you have a hat? Your team may be okay with pivoting for a small period of time to assist, but don’t expect last-minute mandatory overtime to go over well. Your team members have lives outside of the company at which they work and other responsibilities. The work-life balance that’s been established already should be adhered to as much as possible. Those who can stay, will. Those who cannot, won’t. Accept that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful, though. If you press too hard or pull the last-minute card too often, you’ll start building resentment and once your team starts resenting you, either they’ll leave, or they’ll become bitter and cause more problems for you in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;say-no-and-give-a-reason&quot;&gt;Say No and Give a Reason.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit better of a choice, though not the best of the three for one good reason: your reasons may not be good enough for those above you. In some corporate structures, management doesn’t care that your team is already neck-deep in whatever projects they’re working on and can’t be pulled. Sometimes management does understand and accept that such is life. Joe, our friendly drive-by emergency crier won’t like it, for sure, but that’s not your problem. Setting boundaries is key to establishing proper inter-team relationships. It should be made clear who does what, who can cover for whom, what each team’s limits are, and the like. The last thing you need is to accept a last-minute project you can’t follow through on and end up causing more problems and setbacks and having management bear down on you even more than they already may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your team will appreciate that you’re standing in front of them, taking the brunt of the force that is everyone else’s problems, especially if they’re already swamped and don’t have the resources to add more to their respective, metaphorical plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;say-no-with-an-asterisk-aka-i-need-more-information&quot;&gt;Say No with an asterisk (a.k.a: “I need more information”).&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This option can be described as one where you’re basically saying “I need more information before I can make a decision.” This is the best of the three responses but not one others may necessarily like. While it will vary from company to company, some may expect a blind following and anything short of that is insubordination. Watch out for that. If you’re in that situation, you’re probably best getting out and finding a new gig. You don’t need that pressure on you at all times, it will wear you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you basically say “wait a minute,” you’re telling them that you’re not opposed to helping, you just need to know the whole picture so you can make not only an informed decision, but make sure you can allot the resources necessary. This is where triaging of current tasks comes into play and it’s a learned skill. Make a thorough assessment of what’s currently going on in emergency land, then asess what’s going on in your own yard. Gather as much detail as you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The end goal?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What phase(s) has/have already been completed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remaining phase(s)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why is this now an emergency?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What can we do to prevent whatever happened from happening while we’re working to “put out the fire?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many people are needed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the deadline?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why is that date the deadline?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there alternate deadlines available?
While not every one of those items is rock hard crucial to helping complete a last-minute project, it’s important to be able to assess if the project converted to “last-minute” status because of some sort of blocking issue that needs addressing or someone dropped the ball. If it’s the former, then do what you have to do, soldier! Rescue and win the battle with glory and honor. If someone dropped the ball, you need to make sure you’re covered if you start assisting; the last think you need is to go down with a sinking ship that you don’t know is sinking. I’m not saying that you should automatically peace out if you find out that someone oopsed or neglected to do their part. I’m saying you need to cover yourself and your team before you go in. Don’t dive head first into a shallow pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can provide alternate solutions to the problem that is bringing with it buckets of doom, then go for it. It’s entirely possible someone missed something or has been neck-deep in whatever they’re struggling with and failed to see the solution from another angle. While nobody loves a pompous ass, everyone loves a hero, so go be that hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-all-the-options-make-things-worse&quot;&gt;When All the Options Make Things Worse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an invisible line that once crossed, there’s no going back, and you’re better off elsewhere. You might find out that you crossed the line when you get let go because you chose the wrong option and now management wants your head because reasons (i.e. “corporate synergy”). Times like this suck and can be rather chaotic. The effects are longer lasting because it doesn’t just affect you in the short term, it affects those around you who may have depended on you, like your family. All of a sudden, the mortgage is on the line. It’s a tough line to walk and a lot of people aren’t willing to walk it so instead they choose to make whomever they have to happy no matter what the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a decision you’ll have to make on your own. I can’t tell you what to do or what would be the best option. I can however tell you to be confident in whatever decision you make. Your team will look to your for guidance and if you’re not sure of anything, they won’t be sure of you. On the flip side, if you’re always willing to bow and kiss feet at the drop of a hat, your team will look at you as nothing more than a butt kisser. Don’t be that guy. I’ve seen a lot of that in my travels and my experience tells me that being a kissass is like doing heroin: once you start, it’ll be damn hard to stop. Not only that, but whomever’s metaphorical backside you’re planting your metaphorical lips on will get addicted to it, too. They’ll start to realize they can manipulate and basically come to expect that when they say “Jump!” you’ll say “How high?”, regardless if you’re already smacking your head on the ceiling just standing up straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several militaries have a mantra called the “Seven Ps” (“7Ps”):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promotes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are variations such as “Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance” and the six-word version “Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance” which is more along what I belive in on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-forget-youre-still-a-team-player&quot;&gt;Don’t Forget, You’re Still a Team-Player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a bad idea to understand that the nature of working with multiple teams is that from time to time you’ll have to step in. I want to make a disclaimer that all of what I said above should be taken with a grain of salt. A lot of it comes from personal experiences and trials and tribulations. I’ve been in the scenario of the Project Manager where I had to determine if my team really could help out or if I’m just going to send them to the butcher as well as being a member of a team where the PM blindly accepted all requests for emergency assistance that really wasn’t an emergency nor was it appropriate to drop everything and run into the burning building that was a very poorly planned project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;another-disclaimer&quot;&gt;Another Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get mad at me if you get fired over anything I’ve written. These are my opinions and you’re chosing to act on possibly unfounded information. If you value my opinion at all (which I think you do if you made it this far), be careful when sailing in uncharted waters. Don’t be a dick. Don’t get angry. Don’t ruin the vibe of the office, either. People will just hate you. Being professional is key to being respected. Even if you say no, a quality inter-team relationship will survive the decline or modification of a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you have any comments, suggestions or questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. If you’d like, hit me up on twitter. I’d love to have a conversation with you. I’m always open to hearing what other’s think about various topics. There’s never just one way of doing things and something can always be improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I&#8217;m Completely Okay with Being Entrenched in the Apple Ecosystem</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/01/apple-ecosystem/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/01/apple-ecosystem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Typically when I wake up in the morning I don’t have many worthwhile thoughts until well into mid-morning (weekdays) or mid-day (weekends/holidays). Today was supposed to be the latter (New Years Day, a holiday for me) but when I woke up this morning, I realized something shortly after I (while still in bed) grabbed my iPad Mini and started checking emails: I’m deep in the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mac-daddy&quot;&gt;The Mac Daddy.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically this isn’t a completely new revelation and not a statement of fact surrounding something that just happened overnight. I bought my first apple product in 2011 when I bought the Mid-2011 Macbook Pro 15″. While I had used Apple computers before (mostly the white, CRT and first LCD 27″ iMac), I wasn’t super familiar with them. What really convinced me to buy was my job at the time gave me a Mac to use as my daily workhorse (A 13″ Macbook Air) and I found my level of enjoyment increasing every day. I took it home for a while and played with it, doing personal stuff on it and just really enjoyed the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caved about a month later and bought my own Mac. This experience also included the initial sticker shock of spending $2300 (sales tax in Washington State was, at the time, 8.3%… ouch). I was quietly praying and hoping that this investment would last–I was totally right–and I wouldn’t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time I spent with my work-issued Macbook Air gave me time to realize that the computer I use as my daily driver doesn’t need all the tweaking, customization, and granular control over its components like my at-the-time gaming desktop PC did. I couldn’t care less which brand of motherboard I had, nor if I had the maximum amount of RAM I could possibly stuff. I wanted a machine that I could fire up and have just work. I didn’t know this at the time but that idea would end up being my mantra for future device purchases to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iphone-uphone-weallphone&quot;&gt;iPhone, uPhone, weallPhone.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not more than a couple months later, my second step into the Apple pool came with the release of the iPhone 4S. I had already seen the iPhone 4 being used daily by several co-workers and they couldn’t stop drooling and chanting and raving about it. I bit the bullet, renewed my contract with Verzion Wireless, and a couple weeks later (a week earlier than my estimated delivery date), my shiny new phone arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was changing things up from the Motorola Droid X I previously owned. Before the X I had never owned a smartphone so I was still fairly green in the space. I didn’t quite know what to do first: do I listen to music? Do I watch something? I wonder how much of my iTunes library I can fit on this thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the move from Android to iOS was a bit jarring at first, but I can’t go without mentioning that the move was also bittersweet. I enjoyed the fact that I could practically do whatever the hell I wanted to my Droid X, but at the same time, I hated that. When I first made the transition, I switched back and forth a couple times just to make sure I really wanted to change mobile ecosystems. Every time I would go back to Android (version 2.2.3 was the latest version at the time for smartphones), I would find something else I hated-but-didn’t-know-it. First it was the battery life, then it was the lag, then it was lack of quality apps, then it was music management. All of these little things stacked up quickly and within just a couple of weeks, I had tossed my Droid X out for good. I never sold it. I just &lt;em&gt;threw it away&lt;/em&gt; (read: recycled it) using the pre-paid package Verizon sent with my iPhone. I cared zero about getting any money out of it because I hated it that much at the end. I vowed to never buy an android device again (for a few years; more on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fast-forward&quot;&gt;Fast Forward.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the calendar peeled away, 2011 became 2012, 2012 became 2013, and all the while, I was happy as a clam with my iPhone 4S, then subsequently the iPhone 5. The taller screen was a good move by Apple, as it allowed for more vertical space for reading as well as more horizontal real estate to push those YouTube pixels in your face. The introduction of white wasn’t that bad, either–I bought it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the middle of 2013, though, a foreign player came into the game and toyed with my idea of what a great phone should be. This mystical beast of smartphone lore was the Samsung Galaxy S4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;greener-grass-or-something-like-that&quot;&gt;Greener Grass… or something like that.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the idea of the Galaxy S4. It was a bigger phone (5.0″ screen), 1080P resolution, thin almost to the point of anorexia, and lighter than helium, it seemed. It reeled me in with it’s flashiness and promises of being modern and able to help me get all my stuff done better than Apple ever could. Because I’m weak, I caved and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me save you the misery of hearing all about it and skip to the end of this side-story: I dumped it four months later. See, Android and the phones they run on are like conjoined twins: you can’t have one without the other. I enjoyed the hardware that made up the GS4, but hated Android. If I cut one half off, the other would be useless (a.k.a dead in my anatomy analogy). All the things I hated about Android were still true three years later: Even at version 4.0 or whatever the hell it was, music management was fragmented (Google Play Music barf), battery life sucked ( &lt;strong&gt;IDLING&lt;/strong&gt; for six hours doesn’t constitute 80% usage of my battery) thanks to the ominous horse-shit that was the Google Services Framework that I couldn’t control, inability to control my apps and their desire to do whatever the hell they wanted whenever the hell they wanted with stuff like GPS, Bluetooth, etc. The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing that seemed to improve was lag. Android was snappy in its UI, but also snappy like a real housewife of New Jersey. Once I realized nothing had ultimately changed, I couldn’t sell it fast enough. There’s some poor soul out there who traded me their iPhone 5 for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I hope they haven’t killed themselves because of how depressing Android makes people feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tablets-an-interpretive-dance&quot;&gt;Tablets. An Interpretive Dance.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have that iPhone 5 roughly a year and change later, and will eventually invest in an iPhone 6 (or whatever is the latest and greatest when I decide to buy). For the holidays, though, my wife and I decided we needed a slightly larger format for mobile entertainment and have been thinking about tablets for some time. We (literally) instructed everyone to supply Apple Store gift cards as christmas gifts because we wanted iPads. That was it. Unless they felt so inclined to buy one outright, that was their only other option. Anything less was failure (not really). With a supply of gift cards in hand (12 to be exact), we hit up the Apple Store the day after Christmas (Boxing Day!) and aquired two of Apple’s finest iPad Minis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife insisted on getting a gold tablet and while I tend to always want the latest version of whatever exists, I couldn’t validate spending +$100 on TouchID. Her case was valid, as the iPad Mini 2 doesn’t come in gold. I opted for the Space Gray and minus the TouchID, my Mini 2 is technically identical to the Mini 3 she purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand why I waited so long to purchase an iPad. It’s an amazing device that fits the mantra I operate by to this day when it comes to my daily-use home technology: it should just work. The level of craftsmanship is evident even more so in the apps released for it these days. I’m a huge fan of Blizzard’s Hearthstone and Super Evil Megacorp’s Vain Glory. I’m confident there would be some little thing that would screw up an otherwise good experience if I was to purchase an Android tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-a-high-level-i-see&quot;&gt;From a High Level I See.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my communication devices are Apple products. I wrote this story on the same mac I bought in 2011 (which is still kicking serious ass to this day, totally justifying the purchase price), I interact on social media and play games with my iPad, and I listen to music and podcasts while I commute with my iPhone. Each device is similar yet serves different, defined purposes. I rarely play games on my iPhone or my Mac. When I do, it’s Dots 2 or Minecraft, respectively. I also don’t sit on Facebook or Twitter much on my Mac, while I do more so on my iDevices. I don’t listen to music on my iPad or my Mac because I don’t commute with those devices and commuting is the only time I really can tune out and enjoy music (I ride public transportation; tuning out while driving is dangerous, kids.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an arrangement that I love and that works well for me. The Apple ecosystem has pulled me in (although I pretty much went willingly) and has crafted combined experiences for me that I find quite desireable. I don’t use iCloud for anything, though, so there’s that. I’ve had GMail since 2007 and changing email addresses is too much work when there’s no impending doom if I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current arrangement won’t likely change any time soon. I already learned my lesson when I tried to deviate from the plan of the Apple gods. They quietly warned me and I chose to ignore; I doubt I’ll be doing that again. I have zero prospects of purchasing or building a daily-usage Windows PC. If I choose to get back into PC gaming, I might visit it, but with whatever casual gaming I do being targeted towards the PlayStation, there’s little chance that idea will actually come to fruition as another tech product in my home. OS X has been and continues to be a great operating system to work with. I use Windows at work and while it definitely has familiarity on its side and can handle more businessy-corporatey stuff, I would hate to use it at home: too much disparity at this point. Windows Phone will never be an option for me: the ecosystem is barely alive as it is. Developers aren’t interested enough produce let alone maintain quality apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tech nest is solid. I plan on keeping it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ten Dollar Taxidermy</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2014/10/19/taxidermy/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2014/10/19/taxidermy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted so badly to be wrong…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately I wasn’t. Apparently, the phrase ‘ten dollars’ lines up with ‘taxidermy’ more than I wanted. I’m an IT guy and a Photographer, what the hell do I know about taxidermy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-taxidermy&quot;&gt;What Is Taxidermy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead Animals. Scraped clean. Ever carved a pumpkin? Kinda like that. No sharpies, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_102&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-102 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test-1024x832.jpg?resize=882%2C717&quot; alt=&quot;Probably common taxidermy tools... who knows.&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Probably common taxidermy tools… who knows.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;here-kitty-kitty&quot;&gt;Here Kitty Kitty…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably not a coincidence that the idea of small animals having the contents of their body cavity evacuated like Chernobyl never to be occupied by substantial living things again comes up with my cat sitting next to me while I write this. While horrible on at least several different levels, I’d have a good moment of insane laughter if my wife came home to find the cat sitting on the couch as it is now, but staring with cold and soul-less marbles for eyes. Meow kitty kitty… not. Fluffy got stuffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;1*Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ&quot; /&gt;Sometimes the only way to find out if it’s dead is to poke it. I don’t suggest you use your hands, though. Those little fox things have some sharp teeth. Good taxidermy looks like the animal is still alive. While I’m not sure that’s for everyone; those who scare easily might want to stick to simple creatures that when you walk into a dark living room at 2AM, you don’t end up staining the carpet with your fecies. There might be an inherent “turd fee” involved for the more aggressive stuffed animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

In the case of Mr. Leopard to the left, I’m sure whomever worked on him was a true professional, and the owner of this taxidermous monument was quite excited when he got exactly what he asked for: “I need it to look like a weiner dog that got scared. Mmmk? Thanks!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-what-the-f&quot;&gt;The ‘What the F…’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;1*chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw&quot; /&gt;It really didn’t take long to find a WTF example. I was expecting it to take at least three minutes to find an image that really portrays the message I’m trying to convey in this measly paragraph. Unfortunately, I was wrong… again. Sometimes I hate being wrong. I really do. I also wish that sometimes I would hope for the inverse of what I really want so when my new expectations are met, I can feel better about myself. Anti-drinking prevention tip #28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_99&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/de9uL9L7RSmzV4SAoAO5_Lauren-and-Winona-Under-a-pass-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-99 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/de9uL9L7RSmzV4SAoAO5_Lauren-and-Winona-Under-a-pass-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=882%2C588&quot; alt=&quot;Ten bucks says that dog is a fake.&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Ten bucks says that dog is a fake.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now… let’s weave the writing prompt in just a touch more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-i-get-for-ten-dollars&quot;&gt;What Can I Get for Ten Dollars?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s actually a lot harder of a question to answer than I originally thought. Doing a few Google searches in my underwear really only amounts to the most archaic form of finding information with the least amount of effort involved but we’re not all meant to have our noses shoved into books like Charlie Sheen shoved his nose into his… not books… made of powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I had to broaden my horizons a bit, which, while it broadens the idea of ‘taxidermy’ in this discussion, it’s all I can come up with and damn it I have to be right. I’m telling you this story exactly how I want it to be known so deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ-1024x589.png?fit=882%2C882&quot; alt=&quot;Need some new champers? For $4, you can have three sets of teeth! Hell to the mother loving yeah! http://ebay.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyote teeth make great party gifts and door prizes. The cost to enter said door in the first place however is a twisted sense of humor and the willingness to embrace whatever is on the other side. For parties that involve coyote teeth, I doubt there’ll be anything warm and welcoming. It’s probably one of the minor circles of hell, actually. But if you’re into that sort of thing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw-1024x588.png?fit=882%2C882&quot; alt=&quot;1*siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might as well take it all the way. Whatever floats your boat and rids you of that burning sensation in your pocket… which if you’re buying the above, I doubt it was money that’s been burning you all this time. I fear that you’re not meant to be holding a cross… I think you’re alergic to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-how-did-confusion&quot;&gt;What the… How Did… [confusion]?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put up a question on Facebook Friday evening asking for a topic to write about. I didn’t give requirements, boundaries, or suggestions. I just ended the sentence and waited. My call was answered. Combined with Medium’s writing prompt about something related to $10 and my question on Facebook, this sounds like a great way to kill a few hours on a Saturday evening! There’s nothing like sparking the creative spirit with a completely random topic with a random modifier. I have zero interest in taxidermy but it’s quite interesting to see what kind of… eh… stuff people put up for sale. In the case of taxidermy, it’s interesting, bothersome, disturbing, and plain gross sometimes. There are loads of things I can’t unsee and will likely give me nightmares. Oh well. The cost of doing business, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, don’t hesitate to read the rest of my stuff here on  &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jlyman&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, follow me on  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/theejl&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/johnathan.lyman&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or  &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/jlymanphoto&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. I promise I’m not posting (that much) about dead animals (outside the context of this awful topic). See you around!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Create A Photograph</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2014/09/09/photograph/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2014/09/09/photograph</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Level of Entry: Low&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Time to Master: Infinity_There’s a thought in the photography community which extends to pretty much any facet of life: you only get better by doing. One does not become a pro golfer by reading a book—although reading does help—nor does merely buying a professional-grade camera make you a good photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one become a pro, though? If that’s a path you want to take, awesome. If not, don’t worry, as this still applies to even those who want to excel at photography as a hobby or a small side gig to pass the time and pay the photography bills. I’ve broken it down into four super easy steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_129&quot; style=&quot;width: 640px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/F9g2FiPUSyC7IybhyI2p_09.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-129 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/F9g2FiPUSyC7IybhyI2p_09-1024x680.jpg?resize=640%2C425&quot; alt=&quot;Guess what camera took this photo? I bet you can’t.&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Guess what camera took this photo? I bet you can’t.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Get.
At the start of this little conversation I told you a high-end camera does not a pro photographer make. But let’s make sure we differentiate high-end and high-quality. A Canon T5 is a high quality camera based on how its built, but a Canon PowerShot might not feel the same way. Whereas a Canon 1D-X is a high-end camera compared to a Canon T5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(side note: Yes, I could use Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Samsung, etc., but the brand doesn’t matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need to do to complete the “get” phase is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine your budget.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a list of everything you want in a camera.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cross off everything that has anything to do with megapixels, high quantity of auto-focus points, the letters “L” or “G” for Canon or Nikon lenses, frames per second, CompactFlash vs SD, Medium Format. You don’t need any of that extra stuff to take a good photo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a camera lens for less than $200. Your choices are limited. On purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No flashes until you feel comfortable without them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gather the necessary accessories for said camera. This includes a memory card and bag (simple is fine).
Now that you’ve collected your gear, it’s time to get outside and make a photograph of something. (If you have the space, resources, and ability, you can make a photograph indoors, too, but it’s generally cheaper to walk outside than to buy studio equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_122&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/standby.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-122 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/standby-1024x683.jpg?resize=882%2C588&quot; alt=&quot;Or this photo for that matter!&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Or this photo for that matter!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Do.
This is the easiest step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you being, make sure you take your camera out of the box. That’s a key step to becoming fluent in the language of photography. Also, make sure you know it’s controls. The manual is the most detailed source of information on this. If you don’t have a manual, check out your manufacturer’s website. I’ve even provided a few links for you to give you a head start:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer&quot;&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.nikonusa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13948/~/nikon-product-manuals-available-for-download&quot;&gt;Nikon&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsung.com/us/support/#Digital%20Cameras&quot;&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://esupport.sony.com/US/p/select-system.pl?DIRECTOR=DOCS&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/english/support/download_manual.html&quot;&gt;Pentax&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_download_manuals.asp&quot;&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t taken a photo of more than your cat, do take a photo of something other than your cat. If you haven’t taken a photo at night, go do that. Do as much as you can as often as you can. You’ll take loads of crappy photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is the &lt;em&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; step, &lt;em&gt;Do Not&lt;/em&gt; let that break your spirit. You’ll figure out ways to tweak and find your unique touch in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing requires time, of course. If you don’t have hours upon hours of free time to spare, do a 365 project—take a photo of something you haven’t taken a photo of before, every day, for a year. Do that as much as you can. Do take photos with your friends. Of your friends. Around your friends. Of people you want to be friends with. Perfect strangers (ask first—don’t rude).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve taken your daily photo, go take a hundred more of different things. Go to a park. A zoo. A car show. Walk down the street. Walk up the street. Find a bug. Find two bugs. Find a bug killing a bug, National Geographic style!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should be zero people in your life pressuring you to perform here. If anything people around you should be supportive of your new endeavor. Maybe if you ask nicely, they’ll pose for you! If you feel pressured to perform, remove that source of pressure from your life. Stop wishing. Stop comparing. Stop thinking. Now is not the time to think. Now is the time to do, to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dvdhttpsi1wpcomjohnathanlymancomwp-contentuploads201501dvd-1024x683jpgfit8822c882httpsi0wpcomjohnathanlymancomwp-contentuploads201501dvdjpg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dvd.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dvd-1024x683.jpg?fit=882%2C882&quot; alt=&quot;dvd&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Look.
Time to learn. You’ve taken a load of photos and are starting to get a hang of your camera. If not, go back to Step Do. Now’s the time to learn and pretty much down right steal from other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to be very clear, though. By steal, I don’t mean ripping off another’s work and calling it your own. I’ll go into more detail about that, but first let’s talk about learning. There are great free and fee-based learning platforms and videos available on the Internet. In this day and age, a DVD takes second fiddle to instant, on-demand content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great free videos, courses, and platforms include  &lt;a href=&quot;http://petapixel.com/2014/07/03/best-free-online-photography-courses-tutorials/&quot;&gt;this list from PetaPixel&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creativelive.com/photography&quot;&gt;free live events by CreativeLive&lt;/a&gt;, and funny  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/DigitalRevCom&quot;&gt;YouTube videos by DigitalRev&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/PhlearnLLC&quot;&gt;Phlearn&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/thatnikonguy&quot;&gt;Matt Granger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premium platforms include  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lynda.com/Photography-training-tutorials/70-0.html?bnr=NMHP_blocks&quot;&gt;Lynda.com&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://kelbyone.com/&quot;&gt;KelbyOne&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creativelive.com/photography&quot;&gt;CreativeLive’s On Demand video selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch everything you can. If you have to, take notes and watch it again. You can’t watch too many videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve consumed more videos and articles than your brain can handle, find photographers in niches you personally enjoy. Look at their work. Read their blogs. Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, 500px, and any other social networking site they use. Even better, don’t just follow them, chat with them. Reach out to them for tips or really anything you can think of that would possibly help you! If you were to reach out to me on twitter  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/theejl&quot;&gt;@theejl&lt;/a&gt;, I’d respond… just saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, steal from them. Specifically, steal their look. Try to make a photo that looks like that. If it’s something like a landscape or wildlife, capture that same animal or area! When you’ve successfully done that, do it again, with another photographer. I’d be willing to bet cold hard money bags of money that the second photographer you follow or are otherwise interested in their work shoots differently than you do, with a different style. Once you’ve knocked out number two, go for a third, and a fourth. After every attempt or measure of success, make it your own. This’ll help you figure out what your style is. You’ll find yourself going back to what you like the most and over time, tweaking it to make it your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/building.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/building-1024x683.jpg?fit=882%2C882&quot; alt=&quot;building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;repeat&quot;&gt;Repeat.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’ve completed Step Learn. Now what? Do it all over! If only a small amount of time has passed (less than a year), start with Step Do. If it’s been a bit of time or you have the ability to upgrade, do that, with the mindset that you’re upgrading because you can improve yourself with your new gear in ways that you can easily quantify, not just because you like a red band on the end of your lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this to be an endless cycle that even pros will execute from time to time. If you become a full-time professional, you’ll &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be looking for ways to improve and making sure you have everything you need to be as creative and as successful as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s Note: I could have made this list stupid long as in reality there are hundreds of different ways to learn or improve.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://petapixel.com/2014/01/24/40-tips-take-better-photos/&quot;&gt;PetaPixel&lt;/a&gt; went into great detail with quotes from professional photographers that’s definitely worth reading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me what you think of this article. I love hearing from my readers.

   <title>When Things Don’t Go According to Plan</title>
   <link href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2014/09/07/plans/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://johnathanlyman.com/2014/09/07/plans</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why it’s not the end of the world and sometimes you just need to suck it up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ad·ven·ture (n.) — an unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity.I’m a landscape photographer when I’m not studying or working at my day job in IT. My free time is limited but when I have the ability to go on an adventure with my gear I take it. Sometimes, I take a wrong turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With summer coming to an end, I know I only have a few weekends left before fall rolls in and crushes my hopes of a great sunset somewhere new, or awesome weather patterns. See, here in the State of Washington, Fall looks a hell of a lot like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_128&quot; style=&quot;width: 1024px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-128 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04-1024x768.jpg?resize=882%2C662&quot; alt=&quot;Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That freaking sucks. Granted, that photo was taken in Denmark, but Denmark and the Pacific Northwest are pretty close to the same latitudinal line. From October to May, Washington is usually a variation of the above, with a day or two here and there with awesome weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent attempt and wrapping up summer on a high note ended in failure. It was frustrating. I was pissed, but at the same time, I had no right to be. There was not a good reason why I was as frustrated as I felt after realizing I took a terribly wrong turn an hour after I made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was upset, nonetheless. Good thing I had cell service to look up an alternate route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I turn around or keep going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the hell am I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original goal was to arrive at the Johnston Ridge Observatory on the northwest side of the mountain. Instead, I ended up at the end of a road on the south side of the mountain. Good thing I didn’t blow a tire… or run out of gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where my frustration kicks in. Once I realize I’m nowhere near where I want to be, I lose my cool. I got off Interstate 5 about twenty miles too early and there’s no other way to get around the mountain than by backtracking all the way to said freeway. Not only that, but I’m missing my window that I Wanted to arrive by and unless a miracle happens (which none did), I won’t make it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After turning around and driving back the way I came, in search of a cell signal to verify the sinking suspicion I already had, it hits me that this whole problem is really my fault. I wasted the opportunity. I dragged my wife—who is already very tired from a long day with family—to the middle of nowhere only to turn around and go home with &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; to show for it. My wife tries to apologize and while I appreciate her empathy and consideration for how important photography is to me, she did nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-hell-did-we-end-up-here&quot;&gt;How The Hell Did We End Up Here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I’ll tell you. See, when you search for “Mt. St. Helens” on Google Maps, you get &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you searched for. It drops a pin smack freaking dab in the middle of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But guess what? that’s not where I want to go. See I want to go a bit north, to the end of highway 504 (at the top of the image above). Where did Google Maps decide we need to go to reach out destination? About half-way between the pin on the map and the Swift Resivoir at the bottom of the image. Guess what’s out there?  &lt;strong&gt;Nothing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know this was taking place, however, when I asked my wife and adventure co-pilot to get directions to Mt. St. Helens. What I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have asked was to get directions to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, which is exactly where I want to go. Did my wife know that? No. Typically she knows what I tell her because she trusts me and trusts the fact that I know what I’m doing—I’m supposed to be a professional. Reason two why I’m pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, I’m already freakin’ tired, myself, and knowing that I just blew two hours of daylight driving to and from the middle of nowhere makes reason number three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can never have too many of those, and that’s the conclusion I’ve come to. Beyond my frustration, there was regular me understanding that making sure the plan is not only in existence but is correct is quite important. Any adventure you take needs to have some sort of plan, unless the goal is merely to wander without purpose. (You can’t wander with purpose, just so we’re clear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For next time, I know that when I set my route (or my co-pilot in life and in the car, my wonderful wife does it for me), it’s important to make sure that the destination is correct. Everything that happens in the meantime is up in the air and I’m fine with that; that’s what makes an adventure, an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <p>One would think that because I’m a photographer in some capacity that I would take all of my own photos. Let me tell you, that’s certainly not the case. One cannot craft a particular scene in a heartbeat with just enough time to post it to a blog. Good luck with that. </p>

<p>Instead, I use a lot of creative-commons based stock photography. I thought I’d put together a list of sites I source my imagery from in hopes that it helps you in your journey to finding great images for your site.</p>

<p>I have several primary sources I rotate through, depending on what time of the week it is. Most of these sites only update once a week or month with a new “pack” of images.</p>

<h2 id="death-to-the-stock-photo">﻿Death to the Stock Photo</h2>
<p><a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com">DTTSP</a> has two models for delivering photos: free and premium. The free model allows you to receive photos in your email every month in a pack of about ten. They’re high quality images, large enough to print, even, if you so desired. With their premium model, you can get access to their whole archive, not just most recent images for $10 a month. I can’t say that about any big stock photo agency.</p>

<h2 id="unsplash">﻿Unsplash</h2>
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com">A side project</a> by the visual design agency Crew, you’re granted ten new photos every ten days to do whatever you want with. You can view their past images by scrolling and all are was to download right from the site, no membership or sign-up forms required. The images and their themes vary from week to week so don’t hesitate to scroll down a ways and get into past months’ photos.</p>

<h2 id="raumrot">﻿Raumrot</h2>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.raumrot.com/10/">this site</a> because they have categories. A lot of them feel a bit hipster in style but that’s all the rage now from what the kids tell me. Most if not all of their images are hosted on flicker so they’re easy to download. All they ask is a bit of attribution.</p>

<h2 id="little-visuals">﻿Little Visuals</h2>
<p>While not as active anymore as some of the others, <a href="http://littlevisuals.co">their archive</a> is good. They’re not my first choice anymore since they don’t seem to be updating the site with new images, but their archives have a gem once in a while.</p>

<h2 id="new-old-stock">﻿New Old Stock﻿</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://nos.twnsnd.co">great place</a> for older images from the 1920s-1950s, and surrounding time periods. It’s amazing to look at some of these images as they’re genuinely pieces of history. </p>

    <p>Remember yesterday when I mentioned that AdBlock Plus was allowing companies to pay their way through the blocks to users? Turns out, that list is bigger than I led on. In fact, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/over-300-businesses-now-whitelisted-on-adblock-plus-10-pay-to-play/">it’s down right stupid long</a>.</p>

  <p>In an e-mail to Ars, AdBlock Plus Communications Manager Ben Williams wrote that currently, the browser extension has granted a pass to “over 300 sites/entities” out of “over 1,500 applicants” to the company’s whitelist.Damn. Remind me again the point of AdBlock Plus?</p>

    <p>The words “vacate” and “vacation” seem to have two very different connotations in our mind. Looking at news articles tells us just that.</p>

<p><strong>Vacate:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Residents Forced To Vacate From Historic, Problem-Plagued Roseville Building— <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/02/01/residents-forced-to-vacate-from-historic-problem-plagued-roseville-building/">CBS13 Sacramento</a></p>

<p><strong>Vacation:</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>See what I mean? It’s actually a bit difficult to find an article about someone vacating their location and heading to Hawai’i, Milan, or Costa Rica.</p>

    <p>Today is the last day for The Unofficial Apple Weblog. TUAW has been a staple in keeping up with the latest Apple news, products and happenings. The site was always a go-to of mine to keep up to date on rumors, and it did its job well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TUAW, for lots of reasons beyond our control, has no future, but Apple’s burns brightly. It’s been great writing about these growing technologies, and seeing and testing apps — some that were great and some that fell short. All of us here tried to tell the story of Apple and its offspring of hardware and software companies and tell it straight; the good along with the sometimes ugly.— <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2015/02/02/some-final-thoughts/">Mel Martin</a>, TUAW</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re unsure of what that first sentence means let me translate: “TUAW doesn’t write enough fluff. Engadget and TechCrunch do. AOL wants to keep them because fluff pieces make more ad dollars. Without ad dollars, AOL will we all die.”</p>

<p>I can’t help but think that’s why TUAW and coincidentally, Joystiq are taking their final ride today and heading out to pasture. While the revolution of digital media killed off many a good magazine (read: Macworld, Cat Fancy), having a digital publication that people actually enjoy murdered quietly is tough, too. I’m sure TC and Engadget will have plenty of space for the staff from TUAW and Joystiq, but they’re just not the same. Both are end-all-be-all properties that try to cater to everyone and in turn they lose a sliver of their credibility as being the authority on specific things. I wouldn’t trust my local Wal-Mart with high-nor would I trust Radio Shack, either—and I think it’s hard to put faith into a site that tries to pull in 20-somethings for gadget news and then turn around and write about a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/mysecretluxury-is-a-concierge-service-for-romance-love-potentially-sex/">concierge sex service</a>. It never ended there, don’t even get me started on why <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/">a porn site</a> that really wasn’t that special was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/">newsworthy</a>.</p>

<p>To each their own, I guess. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have <a href="http://imore.com">iMore</a>, <a href="http://9to5mac.com">9to5Mac</a>, and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">ArsTechnica</a> to go read.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>“If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot…reading is the creative center of a writer’s life…you cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you.” ~ Stephen KingArguably one of the best fantasy and sci-fi writers of all time with almost four hundred different works written including such epic titles as Carrie, Salem’s Lot, It, Mr. Mercedes, Revival, and more, Stephen Kind makes a great point. With the onslaught of bite-sized media coming at us from all angles (tweets, status updates, Instagram photos) it’s now mainstream to only spend a few minutes reading about any particular topic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll admit, I enjoy bite-sized news as much as the next guy. When I’m checking social media, I’m doing it for one of two reasons: to get a quick update on the day and the world around me and to find something interesting to read about later. The key is the latter. I think if more people sat down and read a book (or at least listened to one), or even consumed more thoughtful and substantial information via something like a Podcast or another educational resource (a single-topic magazine, for example), we’d be overflowing with creativity as a people. Don’t get me wrong, there are loads of creative people in the world, already, and that’s awesome. But there are so many people that have so much to share, but don’t, for one reason or another. </p>

<p>What would have happened if Stephen King never published any of his works because he didn’t feel like they were interesting or he was a good enough writer? You never know who’ll come across your work someday, and in order to be good at writing, one has to be good at reading. I’ve consumed quite a few of Stephen King’s books, personally, and while I started writing for several reasons, his writing stimulated my creative juices in part just enough to help me get to the point where I write something every day of the week. </p>

    <p>I’ve always pondered how much more productive I would be if I had a “dream office” to write and work in. Then I’ve thought about what that office would look like. In reality, I’m not exactly sure I could even come up with a solid example, just some abstract ideas. I sat down for a few minutes to ponder this. </p>

<p>What would your perfect writing/reading/working space look and feel like?</p>

<p>In my world, my writing space would have hard wood floors. Something dark, but not cherry or mahogany dark. I’d need a rolling chair, something that would support my back so I can sit upright. On my desk, I’d need a setup that allowed me to look straight ahead at my monitor or monitors and not have to tilt my head downward. I don’t know if I’d have a laptop, still, or switch to an iMac or similar. The desk itself would likely be minimalist in style, with maybe a drawer or small cabinet underneath to keep the clutter to a minimum. </p>

<p>I would need to have something playing music, probably a small speaker set behind me, nothing too loud or big so as to be distracting. A bookshelf would be nice, to hold all the books I don’t have (I’ll need to buy some books). I feel like the room would need a lot of light either from a window, from lighting fixtures, or both. The lighting can’t be harsh, though. When I’m up writing at 4:30 AM, the last thing I need is harsh light to work with. </p>

<p>Outside of that, I’d have to figure it out as I go along. Perhaps I can find some sort of genie in a magic bottle to grant me this writing space. </p>

    <p>I was looking over all the writing I did for the month of January and I can safely say that not only have I kept one of my New Year’s Resolutions so far, but I blew away my person goal I set for myself. I made a pact with inner me that I would write at least a few times a week and have them be something substantial. According to my count, I posted something 39 times in January and have over 20,000 words to show for it. By that count, with only spending roughly an hour a day writing, I could have a complete book written in a month if I wrote all day. Granted, I don’t have the attention span to do something like that but it makes me feel good to know that I’ve been able to not only meet a goal but to exceed it by a wide margin. <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/249/for-february">I told myself a couple weeks ago</a> that I would write more in February. In reality, the goals has essentially become “write the same amount as you’re currently doing in February.” Writing is something I enjoy quite a bit and have no intent on stopping.</p>

    <p>To follow up my quick review of NatureBox yesterday, I received a second awesome package in the mail on Saturday. I recently ordered a new shave kit from a great company I hadn’t heard of until just recently called Harry’s. Harry’s does things a bit differently. Their claim to fame is they make all their own blades and firmly believe that charging a boat load of cash for a single replacement razor blade is dumb. Here’s what I thought of the kit when I first received it.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1-000585039a409a575b2f9ef2714edc4c.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>I ordered the basic Truman set in dark blue. Other colors include orange,white, and green. With the kit, I received two extra blades, a blade protector, and shave cream (the image above shows gel, which is also an option). Everything I need to get started. Since I already have after-shave that I really like, I opted out of ordering some, for now. </p>

<p>When the box arrived, it showed up in the mail. I could have ordered faster shipping but I think with enough foresight and planning, one could save money and still have their kit or replacement equipment show up on time. (more on their subscription option later).</p>

<p>I opened the box and the first thing I did was pull out the razor. With a blade pre-attached, I essentially had three blades at my disposal. The handle has some heft to it and I really like that. It’s curved and feels good in my hand. </p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1_harrys-delivery-002.png?resize=882%2C588" alt="" /></p>

<p>The shaving cream I opted for smells great and while the tube isn’t very large, it’s enough to get started. I don’t have to continue using their cream or gel if I don’t want, but who knows, I might go for it with their subscription options.</p>

<h2 id="subscribe-to-a-smooth-face">Subscribe to a Smooth Face</h2>
<p>If you’re a regular shaver, be it daily, every other day, or weekly, they have an option that’ll suit your needs. To prevent you from running out of razors, shaving cream, and after-shave, Harry’s will send you everything you need in the right intervals, automatically. Based on how often you shave, they’ll ship you two creams and eight blades every two, three, or five months for $31.00, or you can sign up for your own interval and include gel and aftershave at the interval you choose. ﻿Where else do you know that you can get eight high-quality blade cartridges for less $1.88 each and get shave cream or gel for $8 each? Good question.</p>

<p>Go sign up now with <a href="http://harrys.com">Harry’s</a> and get equipment for a great shave for a great price.</p>

    <p>There’s one thing I’ve always liked and that is super delicious tasty snacks. On top of that, there’s bonus points involved if said snacks are salty. Or sweet. Or anything.</p>

<p>I received what some would call a “care package” in the mail today from a company called NatureBox. See, <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;b=395413&amp;m=41415&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom">NatureBox</a> has this crazy idea that people really enjoy tasty snacks that won’t make you feel gross or regret eating them. I figured I’d give them a shot (I’ll help you do that, too, at the end of this article) and see what they’re all about. I used my ever amazing hookup powers to get a sampler box with four small snack pouches and one full-size bag of something mysterious.</p>

<p>Here’s what I had to think.</p>

<p>I placed my order with <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;b=395413&amp;m=41415&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom">NatureBox</a> on their site and within roughly a full calendar week, I had my box come in the mail. Remember what it was like when grandma sent her world-famous fruit cake to everyone when Christmas came around? Yeah, it’s nothing like that. NatureBox doesn’t do fruit cake, but they do mail stuff. The snacks come in a safe package that won’t let them get crushed or spoiled.</p>

<p>Each full size snack bag is re-sealable, too, which is nice. I’d hate to get some delicious food and at the end of the week have it go bad because I didn’t get to it in time.</p>

<p>A typical order is five bags of goodies from their selection of over 100. If you have a food allergy, their site will filter out what you’re not keen on consuming, including nuts, gluten, eggs, lactose, and soy. Ordering is super easy and only take a couple minutes, just long enough to pick out what you want from their menu.</p>

<p>If you’re too impatient, you can have them ship it out right away, instead of waiting around for your next monthly order to process. A five-snack box is $20 and you can go as high as 20 snacks for $50. Obviously, the more you get, the cheaper they are. If you have a large family or eat a lot of snacks, $50 can go a long way when a lot of the bags are rather hefty in size. The cranberry rice cake snack bag we received was four ounces and contained enough for four servings.</p>

<p>All of NatureBox’s snacks use only the best ingredients and they keep processed stuff out of their foods as much as possible. This means your sugars are pure cane and HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) is absent.</p>

<p>If I could justify ordering $50 worth of snacks in the mail every month, I would go for it. It’ll take a bit of time for my wife to be all right with that, so we’re sticking to the $20/five snack option. With that being said, if you’re not only interested in trying out NatureBox for yourself, but want to get $10 off your first order, <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;b=395413&amp;m=41415&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom">go to their site</a> and use the code <strong>share10off</strong>. When you tell your friends, tell them to use that code, too. They’ll appreciate it.</p>

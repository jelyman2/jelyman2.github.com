        Poor Planning on Your Part Does not Necessarily Constitute an Emergency on Mine
      </a>
    </h1>
    <time datetime="2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">01 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>While some would call him a tool, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Carter" title="Bob Carter">Bob Carter</a>‘s famous statement above rings truer than ever in my world. This post shall kick of a new series on project management faux pas. I’ll be tossing in my every so slightly jaded views and perhaps a rant or two where needed.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="a-fire-drill-is-an-emergency-preparedness-tool-not-a-pm-buzzword">A Fire Drill is an Emergency Preparedness Tool, Not A PM Buzzword</h2>
<p>There’s a boat load of buzzwords used in the corporate workplace that make me want to punch babies. I hear quite a few of them daily and it makes me glad I don’t have kids right now. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, good for you. You haven’t been tainted by middle-management’s eternal goals of making projects as convoluted as possible while wrapping them up with sleazy-marketing-colored paper and ribbon. It’s a common occurence to hear at least one of the well-known words or phrases on the list such as synergy, vertical, circle back, or the one I absolutely hate the most: <strong>fire drill</strong>. Any time someone says something’s a fire drill, I want to tell them “there’s no fire, go sit the fack down.”</p>

<p>Typically, Fire Drills are products of poor planning on someone’s part, and they’re trying to cover their own ass. Everything will subsequently be an emergency and whatever you’re doing, however important it may genuinely be, will no longer be of relevance. This makes the Project Management part of me absolutely rage with hatred so hot, the Seven Circles of Hell have seen nothing like it. The effect is compounded when you don’t have any visibility into the back story or even the entire project. This is where things can get ugly.</p>

<p>The takeaway here is this: do what you can with what you have, and that’s that. Don’t be afraid to say “no” because at some point, you as a project manager, lead, or other member of leadership in your team has to draw a line; your team is important and playing along with someone’s failure to execute will only harm your team more. When you do say “no,” also be prepared for an alternate solution. While you may want to just flip the bird and drop the mic, coherence between teams is crucial lest a company completely fall apart because teams are literally at war with each other.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-triage-a-last-minute-project">How to Triage a Last-Minute Project</h2>
<p>Here’s the scenario: you’ve arrived at the office at your normal time, and team lead Joe from the Development team at XYZ Corp (the company you work for) rushes to your desk and says they need all of your staff to drop whatever they’re doing and do A, B, and C tasks by the end of the day, then scurries back to whatever hole he came out of. You, the PM and leader of your team of elite superhumans, knows very well how quickly a project can go sideways and understands the need to make sure the pieces all fall into place in a timely fashion. Here’s where you have three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically say yes without any second thoughts.</li>
  <li>Say No with an asterisk (a.k.a: “I need more information”).</li>
  <li>Say No and give a reason.
Let’s cover those three options in detail and determine which will create what outcome, starting with the worst-possible choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="automatically-say-yes-without-any-second-thoughts">Automatically Say Yes Without Any Second Thoughts.</h3>
<p>Of the three, this is the worst idea and here’s why: you just arrived. You have no idea what the status of your own team, is, yet. How on God’s green earth can you assume you can pull a rabbit out of your hat if you don’t even know you have a hat? Your team may be okay with pivoting for a small period of time to assist, but don’t expect last-minute mandatory overtime to go over well. Your team members have lives outside of the company at which they work and other responsibilities. The work-life balance that’s been established already should be adhered to as much as possible. Those who can stay, will. Those who cannot, won’t. Accept that.</p>

<p>Be careful, though. If you press too hard or pull the last-minute card too often, you’ll start building resentment and once your team starts resenting you, either they’ll leave, or they’ll become bitter and cause more problems for you in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="say-no-and-give-a-reason">Say No and Give a Reason.</h3>
<p>This is a bit better of a choice, though not the best of the three for one good reason: your reasons may not be good enough for those above you. In some corporate structures, management doesn’t care that your team is already neck-deep in whatever projects they’re working on and can’t be pulled. Sometimes management does understand and accept that such is life. Joe, our friendly drive-by emergency crier won’t like it, for sure, but that’s not your problem. Setting boundaries is key to establishing proper inter-team relationships. It should be made clear who does what, who can cover for whom, what each team’s limits are, and the like. The last thing you need is to accept a last-minute project you can’t follow through on and end up causing more problems and setbacks and having management bear down on you even more than they already may be.</p>

<p>Your team will appreciate that you’re standing in front of them, taking the brunt of the force that is everyone else’s problems, especially if they’re already swamped and don’t have the resources to add more to their respective, metaphorical plates.</p>

<h3 id="say-no-with-an-asterisk-aka-i-need-more-information">Say No with an asterisk (a.k.a: “I need more information”).</h3>
<p>This option can be described as one where you’re basically saying “I need more information before I can make a decision.” This is the best of the three responses but not one others may necessarily like. While it will vary from company to company, some may expect a blind following and anything short of that is insubordination. Watch out for that. If you’re in that situation, you’re probably best getting out and finding a new gig. You don’t need that pressure on you at all times, it will wear you down.</p>

<p>When you basically say “wait a minute,” you’re telling them that you’re not opposed to helping, you just need to know the whole picture so you can make not only an informed decision, but make sure you can allot the resources necessary. This is where triaging of current tasks comes into play and it’s a learned skill. Make a thorough assessment of what’s currently going on in emergency land, then asess what’s going on in your own yard. Gather as much detail as you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The end goal?</li>
  <li>What phase(s) has/have already been completed?</li>
  <li>Remaining phase(s)?</li>
  <li>Why is this now an emergency?</li>
  <li>What can we do to prevent whatever happened from happening while we’re working to “put out the fire?”</li>
  <li>How many people are needed?</li>
  <li>What is the deadline?</li>
  <li>Why is that date the deadline?</li>
  <li>Are there alternate deadlines available?
While not every one of those items is rock hard crucial to helping complete a last-minute project, it’s important to be able to assess if the project converted to “last-minute” status because of some sort of blocking issue that needs addressing or someone dropped the ball. If it’s the former, then do what you have to do, soldier! Rescue and win the battle with glory and honor. If someone dropped the ball, you need to make sure you’re covered if you start assisting; the last think you need is to go down with a sinking ship that you don’t know is sinking. I’m not saying that you should automatically peace out if you find out that someone oopsed or neglected to do their part. I’m saying you need to cover yourself and your team before you go in. Don’t dive head first into a shallow pool.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can provide alternate solutions to the problem that is bringing with it buckets of doom, then go for it. It’s entirely possible someone missed something or has been neck-deep in whatever they’re struggling with and failed to see the solution from another angle. While nobody loves a pompous ass, everyone loves a hero, so go be that hero.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-the-options-make-things-worse">When All the Options Make Things Worse</h2>
<p>There’s an invisible line that once crossed, there’s no going back, and you’re better off elsewhere. You might find out that you crossed the line when you get let go because you chose the wrong option and now management wants your head because reasons (i.e. “corporate synergy”). Times like this suck and can be rather chaotic. The effects are longer lasting because it doesn’t just affect you in the short term, it affects those around you who may have depended on you, like your family. All of a sudden, the mortgage is on the line. It’s a tough line to walk and a lot of people aren’t willing to walk it so instead they choose to make whomever they have to happy no matter what the cost.</p>

<p>This is a decision you’ll have to make on your own. I can’t tell you what to do or what would be the best option. I can however tell you to be confident in whatever decision you make. Your team will look to your for guidance and if you’re not sure of anything, they won’t be sure of you. On the flip side, if you’re always willing to bow and kiss feet at the drop of a hat, your team will look at you as nothing more than a butt kisser. Don’t be that guy. I’ve seen a lot of that in my travels and my experience tells me that being a kissass is like doing heroin: once you start, it’ll be damn hard to stop. Not only that, but whomever’s metaphorical backside you’re planting your metaphorical lips on will get addicted to it, too. They’ll start to realize they can manipulate and basically come to expect that when they say “Jump!” you’ll say “How high?”, regardless if you’re already smacking your head on the ceiling just standing up straight.</p>

<p>Several militaries have a mantra called the “Seven Ps” (“7Ps”):</p>

<p>Piss</p>

<p>Poor</p>

<p>Planning</p>

<p>Promotes</p>

<p>Piss</p>

<p>Poor</p>

<p>Performance.</p>

<p>There are variations such as “Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance” and the six-word version “Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance” which is more along what I belive in on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<h2 id="dont-forget-youre-still-a-team-player">Don’t Forget, You’re Still a Team-Player</h2>
<p>It’s not a bad idea to understand that the nature of working with multiple teams is that from time to time you’ll have to step in. I want to make a disclaimer that all of what I said above should be taken with a grain of salt. A lot of it comes from personal experiences and trials and tribulations. I’ve been in the scenario of the Project Manager where I had to determine if my team really could help out or if I’m just going to send them to the butcher as well as being a member of a team where the PM blindly accepted all requests for emergency assistance that really wasn’t an emergency nor was it appropriate to drop everything and run into the burning building that was a very poorly planned project.</p>

<h3 id="another-disclaimer">Another Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Don’t get mad at me if you get fired over anything I’ve written. These are my opinions and you’re chosing to act on possibly unfounded information. If you value my opinion at all (which I think you do if you made it this far), be careful when sailing in uncharted waters. Don’t be a dick. Don’t get angry. Don’t ruin the vibe of the office, either. People will just hate you. Being professional is key to being respected. Even if you say no, a quality inter-team relationship will survive the decline or modification of a request.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you have any comments, suggestions or questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. If you’d like, hit me up on twitter. I’d love to have a conversation with you. I’m always open to hearing what other’s think about various topics. There’s never just one way of doing things and something can always be improved upon.</p>

        I&#8217;m Completely Okay with Being Entrenched in the Apple Ecosystem
      </a>
    </h1>
    <time datetime="2015-01-01T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">01 Jan 2015</time>
    <p>Typically when I wake up in the morning I don’t have many worthwhile thoughts until well into mid-morning (weekdays) or mid-day (weekends/holidays). Today was supposed to be the latter (New Years Day, a holiday for me) but when I woke up this morning, I realized something shortly after I (while still in bed) grabbed my iPad Mini and started checking emails: I’m deep in the Apple ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="the-mac-daddy">The Mac Daddy.</h2>
<p>Technically this isn’t a completely new revelation and not a statement of fact surrounding something that just happened overnight. I bought my first apple product in 2011 when I bought the Mid-2011 Macbook Pro 15″. While I had used Apple computers before (mostly the white, CRT and first LCD 27″ iMac), I wasn’t super familiar with them. What really convinced me to buy was my job at the time gave me a Mac to use as my daily workhorse (A 13″ Macbook Air) and I found my level of enjoyment increasing every day. I took it home for a while and played with it, doing personal stuff on it and just really enjoyed the experience.</p>

<p>I caved about a month later and bought my own Mac. This experience also included the initial sticker shock of spending $2300 (sales tax in Washington State was, at the time, 8.3%… ouch). I was quietly praying and hoping that this investment would last–I was totally right–and I wouldn’t regret it.</p>

<p>The time I spent with my work-issued Macbook Air gave me time to realize that the computer I use as my daily driver doesn’t need all the tweaking, customization, and granular control over its components like my at-the-time gaming desktop PC did. I couldn’t care less which brand of motherboard I had, nor if I had the maximum amount of RAM I could possibly stuff. I wanted a machine that I could fire up and have just work. I didn’t know this at the time but that idea would end up being my mantra for future device purchases to come.</p>

<h2 id="iphone-uphone-weallphone">iPhone, uPhone, weallPhone.</h2>
<p>Not more than a couple months later, my second step into the Apple pool came with the release of the iPhone 4S. I had already seen the iPhone 4 being used daily by several co-workers and they couldn’t stop drooling and chanting and raving about it. I bit the bullet, renewed my contract with Verzion Wireless, and a couple weeks later (a week earlier than my estimated delivery date), my shiny new phone arrived.</p>

<p>I was changing things up from the Motorola Droid X I previously owned. Before the X I had never owned a smartphone so I was still fairly green in the space. I didn’t quite know what to do first: do I listen to music? Do I watch something? I wonder how much of my iTunes library I can fit on this thing?</p>

<p>Making the move from Android to iOS was a bit jarring at first, but I can’t go without mentioning that the move was also bittersweet. I enjoyed the fact that I could practically do whatever the hell I wanted to my Droid X, but at the same time, I hated that. When I first made the transition, I switched back and forth a couple times just to make sure I really wanted to change mobile ecosystems. Every time I would go back to Android (version 2.2.3 was the latest version at the time for smartphones), I would find something else I hated-but-didn’t-know-it. First it was the battery life, then it was the lag, then it was lack of quality apps, then it was music management. All of these little things stacked up quickly and within just a couple of weeks, I had tossed my Droid X out for good. I never sold it. I just <em>threw it away</em> (read: recycled it) using the pre-paid package Verizon sent with my iPhone. I cared zero about getting any money out of it because I hated it that much at the end. I vowed to never buy an android device again (for a few years; more on that later.)</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward">Fast Forward.</h2>
<p>As the calendar peeled away, 2011 became 2012, 2012 became 2013, and all the while, I was happy as a clam with my iPhone 4S, then subsequently the iPhone 5. The taller screen was a good move by Apple, as it allowed for more vertical space for reading as well as more horizontal real estate to push those YouTube pixels in your face. The introduction of white wasn’t that bad, either–I bought it.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of 2013, though, a foreign player came into the game and toyed with my idea of what a great phone should be. This mystical beast of smartphone lore was the Samsung Galaxy S4.</p>

<h3 id="greener-grass-or-something-like-that">Greener Grass… or something like that.</h3>
<p>I liked the idea of the Galaxy S4. It was a bigger phone (5.0″ screen), 1080P resolution, thin almost to the point of anorexia, and lighter than helium, it seemed. It reeled me in with it’s flashiness and promises of being modern and able to help me get all my stuff done better than Apple ever could. Because I’m weak, I caved and bought it.</p>

<p>Let me save you the misery of hearing all about it and skip to the end of this side-story: I dumped it four months later. See, Android and the phones they run on are like conjoined twins: you can’t have one without the other. I enjoyed the hardware that made up the GS4, but hated Android. If I cut one half off, the other would be useless (a.k.a dead in my anatomy analogy). All the things I hated about Android were still true three years later: Even at version 4.0 or whatever the hell it was, music management was fragmented (Google Play Music barf), battery life sucked ( <strong>IDLING</strong> for six hours doesn’t constitute 80% usage of my battery) thanks to the ominous horse-shit that was the Google Services Framework that I couldn’t control, inability to control my apps and their desire to do whatever the hell they wanted whenever the hell they wanted with stuff like GPS, Bluetooth, etc. The <em>only</em> thing that seemed to improve was lag. Android was snappy in its UI, but also snappy like a real housewife of New Jersey. Once I realized nothing had ultimately changed, I couldn’t sell it fast enough. There’s some poor soul out there who traded me their iPhone 5 for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I hope they haven’t killed themselves because of how depressing Android makes people feel.</p>

<h2 id="tablets-an-interpretive-dance">Tablets. An Interpretive Dance.</h2>
<p>I still have that iPhone 5 roughly a year and change later, and will eventually invest in an iPhone 6 (or whatever is the latest and greatest when I decide to buy). For the holidays, though, my wife and I decided we needed a slightly larger format for mobile entertainment and have been thinking about tablets for some time. We (literally) instructed everyone to supply Apple Store gift cards as christmas gifts because we wanted iPads. That was it. Unless they felt so inclined to buy one outright, that was their only other option. Anything less was failure (not really). With a supply of gift cards in hand (12 to be exact), we hit up the Apple Store the day after Christmas (Boxing Day!) and aquired two of Apple’s finest iPad Minis.</p>

<p>My wife insisted on getting a gold tablet and while I tend to always want the latest version of whatever exists, I couldn’t validate spending +$100 on TouchID. Her case was valid, as the iPad Mini 2 doesn’t come in gold. I opted for the Space Gray and minus the TouchID, my Mini 2 is technically identical to the Mini 3 she purchased.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why I waited so long to purchase an iPad. It’s an amazing device that fits the mantra I operate by to this day when it comes to my daily-use home technology: it should just work. The level of craftsmanship is evident even more so in the apps released for it these days. I’m a huge fan of Blizzard’s Hearthstone and Super Evil Megacorp’s Vain Glory. I’m confident there would be some little thing that would screw up an otherwise good experience if I was to purchase an Android tablet.</p>

<h2 id="from-a-high-level-i-see">From a High Level I See.</h2>
<p>All of my communication devices are Apple products. I wrote this story on the same mac I bought in 2011 (which is still kicking serious ass to this day, totally justifying the purchase price), I interact on social media and play games with my iPad, and I listen to music and podcasts while I commute with my iPhone. Each device is similar yet serves different, defined purposes. I rarely play games on my iPhone or my Mac. When I do, it’s Dots 2 or Minecraft, respectively. I also don’t sit on Facebook or Twitter much on my Mac, while I do more so on my iDevices. I don’t listen to music on my iPad or my Mac because I don’t commute with those devices and commuting is the only time I really can tune out and enjoy music (I ride public transportation; tuning out while driving is dangerous, kids.)</p>

<p>This is an arrangement that I love and that works well for me. The Apple ecosystem has pulled me in (although I pretty much went willingly) and has crafted combined experiences for me that I find quite desireable. I don’t use iCloud for anything, though, so there’s that. I’ve had GMail since 2007 and changing email addresses is too much work when there’s no impending doom if I don’t.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>My current arrangement won’t likely change any time soon. I already learned my lesson when I tried to deviate from the plan of the Apple gods. They quietly warned me and I chose to ignore; I doubt I’ll be doing that again. I have zero prospects of purchasing or building a daily-usage Windows PC. If I choose to get back into PC gaming, I might visit it, but with whatever casual gaming I do being targeted towards the PlayStation, there’s little chance that idea will actually come to fruition as another tech product in my home. OS X has been and continues to be a great operating system to work with. I use Windows at work and while it definitely has familiarity on its side and can handle more businessy-corporatey stuff, I would hate to use it at home: too much disparity at this point. Windows Phone will never be an option for me: the ecosystem is barely alive as it is. Developers aren’t interested enough produce let alone maintain quality apps.</p>

<p>My tech nest is solid. I plan on keeping it that way.</p>

        Ten Dollar Taxidermy

    <time datetime="2014-10-19T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">19 Oct 2014</time>
    <p>I wanted so badly to be wrong…</p>

<p>But unfortunately I wasn’t. Apparently, the phrase ‘ten dollars’ lines up with ‘taxidermy’ more than I wanted. I’m an IT guy and a Photographer, what the hell do I know about taxidermy?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-taxidermy">What Is Taxidermy?</h3>
<p>Dead Animals. Scraped clean. Ever carved a pumpkin? Kinda like that. No sharpies, though.</p>

<figure id="attachment_102" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test.jpg"><img class="wp-image-102 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test-1024x832.jpg?resize=882%2C717" alt="Probably common taxidermy tools... who knows." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Probably common taxidermy tools… who knows.</figcaption></figure>
<p> </p>

<h3 id="here-kitty-kitty">Here Kitty Kitty…</h3>
<p>It’s probably not a coincidence that the idea of small animals having the contents of their body cavity evacuated like Chernobyl never to be occupied by substantial living things again comes up with my cat sitting next to me while I write this. While horrible on at least several different levels, I’d have a good moment of insane laughter if my wife came home to find the cat sitting on the couch as it is now, but staring with cold and soul-less marbles for eyes. Meow kitty kitty… not. Fluffy got stuffed.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ" />Sometimes the only way to find out if it’s dead is to poke it. I don’t suggest you use your hands, though. Those little fox things have some sharp teeth. Good taxidermy looks like the animal is still alive. While I’m not sure that’s for everyone; those who scare easily might want to stick to simple creatures that when you walk into a dark living room at 2AM, you don’t end up staining the carpet with your fecies. There might be an inherent “turd fee” involved for the more aggressive stuffed animals.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p> </p>

In the case of Mr. Leopard to the left, I’m sure whomever worked on him was a true professional, and the owner of this taxidermous monument was quite excited when he got exactly what he asked for: “I need it to look like a weiner dog that got scared. Mmmk? Thanks!”</p>

I was expecting it to take at least three minutes to find an image that really portrays the message I’m trying to convey in this measly paragraph. Unfortunately, I was wrong… again. Sometimes I hate being wrong. I really do. I also wish that sometimes I would hope for the inverse of what I really want so when my new expectations are met, I can feel better about myself.

<p> </p>

<p>And now… let’s weave the writing prompt in just a touch more.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-i-get-for-ten-dollars">What Can I Get for Ten Dollars?</h3>
<p>That’s actually a lot harder of a question to answer than I originally thought. Doing a few Google searches in my underwear really only amounts to the most archaic form of finding information with the least amount of effort involved but we’re not all meant to have our noses shoved into books like Charlie Sheen shoved his nose into his… not books… made of powder.</p>

<p>Turns out I had to broaden my horizons a bit, which, while it broadens the idea of ‘taxidermy’ in this discussion, it’s all I can come up with and damn it I have to be right. I’m telling you this story exactly how I want it to be known so deal with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ-1024x589.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="Need some new champers? For $4, you can have three sets of teeth! Hell to the mother loving yeah! http://ebay.com" /></a></p>

<p>Coyote teeth make great party gifts and door prizes. The cost to enter said door in the first place however is a twisted sense of humor and the willingness to embrace whatever is on the other side. For parties that involve coyote teeth, I doubt there’ll be anything warm and welcoming. It’s probably one of the minor circles of hell, actually. But if you’re into that sort of thing…</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw-1024x588.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="1*siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw" /></a></p>

<p>You might as well take it all the way. Whatever floats your boat and rids you of that burning sensation in your pocket… which if you’re buying the above, I doubt it was money that’s been burning you all this time. I fear that you’re not meant to be holding a cross… I think you’re alergic to it.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-how-did-confusion">What the… How Did… [confusion]?</h3>
<p>I put up a question on Facebook Friday evening asking for a topic to write about. I didn’t give requirements, boundaries, or suggestions. I just ended the sentence and waited. My call was answered. Combined with Medium’s writing prompt about something related to $10 and my question on Facebook, this sounds like a great way to kill a few hours on a Saturday evening! There’s nothing like sparking the creative spirit with a completely random topic with a random modifier. I have zero interest in taxidermy but it’s quite interesting to see what kind of… eh… stuff people put up for sale. In the case of taxidermy, it’s interesting, bothersome, disturbing, and plain gross sometimes. There are loads of things I can’t unsee and will likely give me nightmares. Oh well. The cost of doing business, I guess.</p>

        Create A Photograph

    <time datetime="2014-09-09T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">09 Sep 2014</time>
    <p><em>Level of Entry: Low</em></p>

<p>_Time to Master: Infinity_There’s a thought in the photography community which extends to pretty much any facet of life: you only get better by doing. One does not become a pro golfer by reading a book—although reading does help—nor does merely buying a professional-grade camera make you a good photographer.</p>

<p>How does one become a pro, though? If that’s a path you want to take, awesome. If not, don’t worry, as this still applies to even those who want to excel at photography as a hobby or a small side gig to pass the time and pay the photography bills. I’ve broken it down into four super easy steps.</p>

<figure id="attachment_129" style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/F9g2FiPUSyC7IybhyI2p_09.jpg"><img class="wp-image-129 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/F9g2FiPUSyC7IybhyI2p_09-1024x680.jpg?resize=640%2C425" alt="Guess what camera took this photo? I bet you can’t." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Guess what camera took this photo? I bet you can’t.</figcaption></figure>
<p>## Get.
At the start of this little conversation I told you a high-end camera does not a pro photographer make. But let’s make sure we differentiate high-end and high-quality. A Canon T5 is a high quality camera based on how its built, but a Canon PowerShot might not feel the same way. Whereas a Canon 1D-X is a high-end camera compared to a Canon T5.</p>

<p>(side note: Yes, I could use Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Samsung, etc., but the brand doesn’t matter.)</p>

<p>What you need to do to complete the “get” phase is this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine your budget.</li>
  <li>Make a list of everything you want in a camera.</li>
  <li>Cross off everything that has anything to do with megapixels, high quantity of auto-focus points, the letters “L” or “G” for Canon or Nikon lenses, frames per second, CompactFlash vs SD, Medium Format. You don’t need any of that extra stuff to take a good photo.</li>
  <li>Find a camera lens for less than $200. Your choices are limited. On purpose.</li>
  <li>No flashes until you feel comfortable without them.</li>
  <li>Gather the necessary accessories for said camera. This includes a memory card and bag (simple is fine).
Now that you’ve collected your gear, it’s time to get outside and make a photograph of something. (If you have the space, resources, and ability, you can make a photograph indoors, too, but it’s generally cheaper to walk outside than to buy studio equipment.</li>
</ul>

<figure id="attachment_122" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/standby.jpg"><img class="wp-image-122 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/standby-1024x683.jpg?resize=882%2C588" alt="Or this photo for that matter!" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Or this photo for that matter!</figcaption></figure>
<p>## Do.
This is the easiest step.</p>

<p>Before you being, make sure you take your camera out of the box. That’s a key step to becoming fluent in the language of photography. Also, make sure you know it’s controls. The manual is the most detailed source of information on this. If you don’t have a manual, check out your manufacturer’s website. I’ve even provided a few links for you to give you a head start:  <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer">Canon</a>,  <a href="https://support.nikonusa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13948/~/nikon-product-manuals-available-for-download">Nikon</a>,  <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/#Digital%20Cameras">Samsung</a>,  <a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/p/select-system.pl?DIRECTOR=DOCS">Sony</a>,  <a href="http://www.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/english/support/download_manual.html">Pentax</a>,  <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_download_manuals.asp">Olympus</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven’t taken a photo of more than your cat, do take a photo of something other than your cat. If you haven’t taken a photo at night, go do that. Do as much as you can as often as you can. You’ll take loads of crappy photos.</p>

<p>While this is the <em>Do</em> step, <em>Do Not</em> let that break your spirit. You’ll figure out ways to tweak and find your unique touch in the next step.</p>

<p>Doing requires time, of course. If you don’t have hours upon hours of free time to spare, do a 365 project—take a photo of something you haven’t taken a photo of before, every day, for a year. Do that as much as you can. Do take photos with your friends. Of your friends. Around your friends. Of people you want to be friends with. Perfect strangers (ask first—don’t rude).</p>

<p>Once you’ve taken your daily photo, go take a hundred more of different things. Go to a park. A zoo. A car show. Walk down the street. Walk up the street. Find a bug. Find two bugs. Find a bug killing a bug, National Geographic style!</p>

<p>There should be zero people in your life pressuring you to perform here. If anything people around you should be supportive of your new endeavor. Maybe if you ask nicely, they’ll pose for you! If you feel pressured to perform, remove that source of pressure from your life. Stop wishing. Stop comparing. Stop thinking. Now is not the time to think. Now is the time to do, to make.</p>

<p>Getting the idea?</p>

<p>## Look.
Time to learn. You’ve taken a load of photos and are starting to get a hang of your camera. If not, go back to Step Do. Now’s the time to learn and pretty much down right steal from other people.</p>

<p>We need to be very clear, though. By steal, I don’t mean ripping off another’s work and calling it your own. I’ll go into more detail about that, but first let’s talk about learning. There are great free and fee-based learning platforms and videos available on the Internet. In this day and age, a DVD takes second fiddle to instant, on-demand content.</p>

<p>Great free videos, courses, and platforms include  <a href="http://petapixel.com/2014/07/03/best-free-online-photography-courses-tutorials/">this list from PetaPixel</a>,  <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/photography">free live events by CreativeLive</a>, and funny  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DigitalRevCom">YouTube videos by DigitalRev</a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhlearnLLC">Phlearn</a>, and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thatnikonguy">Matt Granger</a>.</p>

<p>Premium platforms include  <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Photography-training-tutorials/70-0.html?bnr=NMHP_blocks">Lynda.com</a>,  <a href="http://kelbyone.com/">KelbyOne</a>, and  <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/photography">CreativeLive’s On Demand video selection</a>.</p>

<p>Watch everything you can. If you have to, take notes and watch it again. You can’t watch too many videos.</p>

<p>Once you’ve consumed more videos and articles than your brain can handle, find photographers in niches you personally enjoy. Look at their work. Read their blogs. Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, 500px, and any other social networking site they use. Even better, don’t just follow them, chat with them. Reach out to them for tips or really anything you can think of that would possibly help you! If you were to reach out to me on twitter  <a href="https://twitter.com/theejl">@theejl</a>, I’d respond… just saying.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, steal from them. Specifically, steal their look. Try to make a photo that looks like that. If it’s something like a landscape or wildlife, capture that same animal or area! When you’ve successfully done that, do it again, with another photographer. I’d be willing to bet cold hard money bags of money that the second photographer you follow or are otherwise interested in their work shoots differently than you do, with a different style. Once you’ve knocked out number two, go for a third, and a fourth. After every attempt or measure of success, make it your own. This’ll help you figure out what your style is. You’ll find yourself going back to what you like the most and over time, tweaking it to make it your own.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/building.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/building-1024x683.jpg?fit=882%2C882" alt="building" /></a></p>

<h3 id="repeat">Repeat.</h3>
<p>So you’ve completed Step Learn. Now what? Do it all over! If only a small amount of time has passed (less than a year), start with Step Do. If it’s been a bit of time or you have the ability to upgrade, do that, with the mindset that you’re upgrading because you can improve yourself with your new gear in ways that you can easily quantify, not just because you like a red band on the end of your lens.</p>

<p>You’ll find this to be an endless cycle that even pros will execute from time to time. If you become a full-time professional, you’ll <em>always</em> be looking for ways to improve and making sure you have everything you need to be as creative and as successful as possible.</p>

    <p><em>Why it’s not the end of the world and sometimes you just need to suck it up.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ad·ven·ture (n.) — an unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity.I’m a landscape photographer when I’m not studying or working at my day job in IT. My free time is limited but when I have the ability to go on an adventure with my gear I take it. Sometimes, I take a wrong turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With summer coming to an end, I know I only have a few weekends left before fall rolls in and crushes my hopes of a great sunset somewhere new, or awesome weather patterns. See, here in the State of Washington, Fall looks a hell of a lot like this:</p>

<figure id="attachment_128" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-128 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04-1024x768.jpg?resize=882%2C662" alt="Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>That freaking sucks. Granted, that photo was taken in Denmark, but Denmark and the Pacific Northwest are pretty close to the same latitudinal line. From October to May, Washington is usually a variation of the above, with a day or two here and there with awesome weather.</p>

<p>My most recent attempt and wrapping up summer on a high note ended in failure. It was frustrating. I was pissed, but at the same time, I had no right to be. There was not a good reason why I was as frustrated as I felt after realizing I took a terribly wrong turn an hour after I made it.</p>

<p>But I was upset, nonetheless. Good thing I had cell service to look up an alternate route.</p>

<p>Oh wait.</p>

<p>I didn’t.</p>

<p>Crap.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>Do I turn around or keep going?</p>

<p>Where the hell am I?</p>

<p>My original goal was to arrive at the Johnston Ridge Observatory on the northwest side of the mountain. Instead, I ended up at the end of a road on the south side of the mountain. Good thing I didn’t blow a tire… or run out of gas.</p>

<p>Here’s where my frustration kicks in. Once I realize I’m nowhere near where I want to be, I lose my cool. I got off Interstate 5 about twenty miles too early and there’s no other way to get around the mountain than by backtracking all the way to said freeway. Not only that, but I’m missing my window that I Wanted to arrive by and unless a miracle happens (which none did), I won’t make it at all.</p>

<p>After turning around and driving back the way I came, in search of a cell signal to verify the sinking suspicion I already had, it hits me that this whole problem is really my fault. I wasted the opportunity. I dragged my wife—who is already very tired from a long day with family—to the middle of nowhere only to turn around and go home with <em>zero</em> to show for it. My wife tries to apologize and while I appreciate her empathy and consideration for how important photography is to me, she did nothing wrong.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-hell-did-we-end-up-here">How The Hell Did We End Up Here?</h3>
<p>Well I’ll tell you. See, when you search for “Mt. St. Helens” on Google Maps, you get <em>exactly</em> what you searched for. It drops a pin smack freaking dab in the middle of the mountain.</p>

<p>But guess what? that’s not where I want to go. See I want to go a bit north, to the end of highway 504 (at the top of the image above). Where did Google Maps decide we need to go to reach out destination? About half-way between the pin on the map and the Swift Resivoir at the bottom of the image. Guess what’s out there?  <strong>Nothing</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t know this was taking place, however, when I asked my wife and adventure co-pilot to get directions to Mt. St. Helens. What I <em>should</em> have asked was to get directions to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, which is exactly where I want to go. Did my wife know that? No. Typically she knows what I tell her because she trusts me and trusts the fact that I know what I’m doing—I’m supposed to be a professional. Reason two why I’m pissed off.</p>

<p>To top it all off, I’m already freakin’ tired, myself, and knowing that I just blew two hours of daylight driving to and from the middle of nowhere makes reason number three.</p>

<h3 id="nut-up-and-write-it-off-as-another-learning-experience">Nut up and write it off as another learning experience.</h3>
<p>You can never have too many of those, and that’s the conclusion I’ve come to. Beyond my frustration, there was regular me understanding that making sure the plan is not only in existence but is correct is quite important. Any adventure you take needs to have some sort of plan, unless the goal is merely to wander without purpose. (You can’t wander with purpose, just so we’re clear).</p>

<p>For next time, I know that when I set my route (or my co-pilot in life and in the car, my wonderful wife does it for me), it’s important to make sure that the destination is correct. Everything that happens in the meantime is up in the air and I’m fine with that; that’s what makes an adventure, an adventure.</p>

        Ten Dollar Taxidermy
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2014-10-19T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">19 Oct 2014</time>

    <p>I wanted so badly to be wrong…</p>

<p>But unfortunately I wasn’t. Apparently, the phrase ‘ten dollars’ lines up with ‘taxidermy’ more than I wanted. I’m an IT guy and a Photographer, what the hell do I know about taxidermy?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-taxidermy">What Is Taxidermy?</h3>
<p>Dead Animals. Scraped clean. Ever carved a pumpkin? Kinda like that. No sharpies, though.</p>

<figure id="attachment_102" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test.jpg"><img class="wp-image-102 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oIpwxeeSPy1cnwYpqJ1w_Dufer-Collateral-test-1024x832.jpg?resize=882%2C717" alt="Probably common taxidermy tools... who knows." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Probably common taxidermy tools… who knows.</figcaption></figure>
<p> </p>

<h3 id="here-kitty-kitty">Here Kitty Kitty…</h3>
<p>It’s probably not a coincidence that the idea of small animals having the contents of their body cavity evacuated like Chernobyl never to be occupied by substantial living things again comes up with my cat sitting next to me while I write this. While horrible on at least several different levels, I’d have a good moment of insane laughter if my wife came home to find the cat sitting on the couch as it is now, but staring with cold and soul-less marbles for eyes. Meow kitty kitty… not. Fluffy got stuffed.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*Ofyqq1Eb7u4CNBf8_KVwmQ" />Sometimes the only way to find out if it’s dead is to poke it. I don’t suggest you use your hands, though. Those little fox things have some sharp teeth. Good taxidermy looks like the animal is still alive. While I’m not sure that’s for everyone; those who scare easily might want to stick to simple creatures that when you walk into a dark living room at 2AM, you don’t end up staining the carpet with your fecies. There might be an inherent “turd fee” involved for the more aggressive stuffed animals.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p> </p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1lzOD7faBv6kv9RkQXi3A2g-300x210.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*lzOD7faBv6kv9RkQXi3A2g" />Like in all professions, you end up working with someone who’s less than professional. In the case of Mr. Leopard to the left, I’m sure whomever worked on him was a true professional, and the owner of this taxidermous monument was quite excited when he got exactly what he asked for: “I need it to look like a weiner dog that got scared. Mmmk? Thanks!”</p>

<h3 id="the-what-the-f">The ‘What the F…’</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw-300x225.jpeg?fit=300%2C300" alt="1*chpn1suAqoT1pVZrMwudZw" />It really didn’t take long to find a WTF example. I was expecting it to take at least three minutes to find an image that really portrays the message I’m trying to convey in this measly paragraph. Unfortunately, I was wrong… again. Sometimes I hate being wrong. I really do. I also wish that sometimes I would hope for the inverse of what I really want so when my new expectations are met, I can feel better about myself. Anti-drinking prevention tip #28.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And now… let’s weave the writing prompt in just a touch more.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-i-get-for-ten-dollars">What Can I Get for Ten Dollars?</h3>
<p>That’s actually a lot harder of a question to answer than I originally thought. Doing a few Google searches in my underwear really only amounts to the most archaic form of finding information with the least amount of effort involved but we’re not all meant to have our noses shoved into books like Charlie Sheen shoved his nose into his… not books… made of powder.</p>

<p>Turns out I had to broaden my horizons a bit, which, while it broadens the idea of ‘taxidermy’ in this discussion, it’s all I can come up with and damn it I have to be right. I’m telling you this story exactly how I want it to be known so deal with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1IUGlf42yRPCkLiGczh0kQQ-1024x589.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="Need some new champers? For $4, you can have three sets of teeth! Hell to the mother loving yeah! http://ebay.com" /></a></p>

<p>Coyote teeth make great party gifts and door prizes. The cost to enter said door in the first place however is a twisted sense of humor and the willingness to embrace whatever is on the other side. For parties that involve coyote teeth, I doubt there’ll be anything warm and welcoming. It’s probably one of the minor circles of hell, actually. But if you’re into that sort of thing…</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw-1024x588.png?fit=882%2C882" alt="1*siIPMlGT9qSf6Hq5mhNrmw" /></a></p>

<p>You might as well take it all the way. Whatever floats your boat and rids you of that burning sensation in your pocket… which if you’re buying the above, I doubt it was money that’s been burning you all this time. I fear that you’re not meant to be holding a cross… I think you’re alergic to it.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-how-did-confusion">What the… How Did… [confusion]?</h3>
<p>I put up a question on Facebook Friday evening asking for a topic to write about. I didn’t give requirements, boundaries, or suggestions. I just ended the sentence and waited. My call was answered. Combined with Medium’s writing prompt about something related to $10 and my question on Facebook, this sounds like a great way to kill a few hours on a Saturday evening! There’s nothing like sparking the creative spirit with a completely random topic with a random modifier. I have zero interest in taxidermy but it’s quite interesting to see what kind of… eh… stuff people put up for sale. In the case of taxidermy, it’s interesting, bothersome, disturbing, and plain gross sometimes. There are loads of things I can’t unsee and will likely give me nightmares. Oh well. The cost of doing business, I guess.</p>

        Create A Photograph
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2014-09-09T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">09 Sep 2014</time>

    <p><em>Level of Entry: Low</em></p>

<p>_Time to Master: Infinity_There’s a thought in the photography community which extends to pretty much any facet of life: you only get better by doing. One does not become a pro golfer by reading a book—although reading does help—nor does merely buying a professional-grade camera make you a good photographer.</p>

<p>How does one become a pro, though? If that’s a path you want to take, awesome. If not, don’t worry, as this still applies to even those who want to excel at photography as a hobby or a small side gig to pass the time and pay the photography bills. I’ve broken it down into four super easy steps.</p>

<figure id="attachment_129" style="width: 640px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/F9g2FiPUSyC7IybhyI2p_09.jpg"><img class="wp-image-129 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/F9g2FiPUSyC7IybhyI2p_09-1024x680.jpg?resize=640%2C425" alt="Guess what camera took this photo? I bet you can’t." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Guess what camera took this photo? I bet you can’t.</figcaption></figure>
<p>## Get.
At the start of this little conversation I told you a high-end camera does not a pro photographer make. But let’s make sure we differentiate high-end and high-quality. A Canon T5 is a high quality camera based on how its built, but a Canon PowerShot might not feel the same way. Whereas a Canon 1D-X is a high-end camera compared to a Canon T5.</p>

<p>(side note: Yes, I could use Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Samsung, etc., but the brand doesn’t matter.)</p>

<p>What you need to do to complete the “get” phase is this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine your budget.</li>
  <li>Make a list of everything you want in a camera.</li>
  <li>Cross off everything that has anything to do with megapixels, high quantity of auto-focus points, the letters “L” or “G” for Canon or Nikon lenses, frames per second, CompactFlash vs SD, Medium Format. You don’t need any of that extra stuff to take a good photo.</li>
  <li>Find a camera lens for less than $200. Your choices are limited. On purpose.</li>
  <li>No flashes until you feel comfortable without them.</li>
  <li>Gather the necessary accessories for said camera. This includes a memory card and bag (simple is fine).
Now that you’ve collected your gear, it’s time to get outside and make a photograph of something. (If you have the space, resources, and ability, you can make a photograph indoors, too, but it’s generally cheaper to walk outside than to buy studio equipment.</li>
</ul>

<figure id="attachment_122" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/standby.jpg"><img class="wp-image-122 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/standby-1024x683.jpg?resize=882%2C588" alt="Or this photo for that matter!" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Or this photo for that matter!</figcaption></figure>
<p>## Do.
This is the easiest step.</p>

<p>Before you being, make sure you take your camera out of the box. That’s a key step to becoming fluent in the language of photography. Also, make sure you know it’s controls. The manual is the most detailed source of information on this. If you don’t have a manual, check out your manufacturer’s website. I’ve even provided a few links for you to give you a head start:  <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer">Canon</a>,  <a href="https://support.nikonusa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13948/~/nikon-product-manuals-available-for-download">Nikon</a>,  <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/#Digital%20Cameras">Samsung</a>,  <a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/p/select-system.pl?DIRECTOR=DOCS">Sony</a>,  <a href="http://www.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/english/support/download_manual.html">Pentax</a>,  <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_download_manuals.asp">Olympus</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven’t taken a photo of more than your cat, do take a photo of something other than your cat. If you haven’t taken a photo at night, go do that. Do as much as you can as often as you can. You’ll take loads of crappy photos.</p>

<p>While this is the <em>Do</em> step, <em>Do Not</em> let that break your spirit. You’ll figure out ways to tweak and find your unique touch in the next step.</p>

<p>Doing requires time, of course. If you don’t have hours upon hours of free time to spare, do a 365 project—take a photo of something you haven’t taken a photo of before, every day, for a year. Do that as much as you can. Do take photos with your friends. Of your friends. Around your friends. Of people you want to be friends with. Perfect strangers (ask first—don’t rude).</p>

<p>Once you’ve taken your daily photo, go take a hundred more of different things. Go to a park. A zoo. A car show. Walk down the street. Walk up the street. Find a bug. Find two bugs. Find a bug killing a bug, National Geographic style!</p>

<p>There should be zero people in your life pressuring you to perform here. If anything people around you should be supportive of your new endeavor. Maybe if you ask nicely, they’ll pose for you! If you feel pressured to perform, remove that source of pressure from your life. Stop wishing. Stop comparing. Stop thinking. Now is not the time to think. Now is the time to do, to make.</p>

<p>Getting the idea?</p>

<p>## Look.
Time to learn. You’ve taken a load of photos and are starting to get a hang of your camera. If not, go back to Step Do. Now’s the time to learn and pretty much down right steal from other people.</p>

<p>We need to be very clear, though. By steal, I don’t mean ripping off another’s work and calling it your own. I’ll go into more detail about that, but first let’s talk about learning. There are great free and fee-based learning platforms and videos available on the Internet. In this day and age, a DVD takes second fiddle to instant, on-demand content.</p>

<p>Great free videos, courses, and platforms include  <a href="http://petapixel.com/2014/07/03/best-free-online-photography-courses-tutorials/">this list from PetaPixel</a>,  <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/photography">free live events by CreativeLive</a>, and funny  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DigitalRevCom">YouTube videos by DigitalRev</a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhlearnLLC">Phlearn</a>, and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thatnikonguy">Matt Granger</a>.</p>

<p>Premium platforms include  <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Photography-training-tutorials/70-0.html?bnr=NMHP_blocks">Lynda.com</a>,  <a href="http://kelbyone.com/">KelbyOne</a>, and  <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/photography">CreativeLive’s On Demand video selection</a>.</p>

<p>Watch everything you can. If you have to, take notes and watch it again. You can’t watch too many videos.</p>

<p>Once you’ve consumed more videos and articles than your brain can handle, find photographers in niches you personally enjoy. Look at their work. Read their blogs. Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, 500px, and any other social networking site they use. Even better, don’t just follow them, chat with them. Reach out to them for tips or really anything you can think of that would possibly help you! If you were to reach out to me on twitter  <a href="https://twitter.com/theejl">@theejl</a>, I’d respond… just saying.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, steal from them. Specifically, steal their look. Try to make a photo that looks like that. If it’s something like a landscape or wildlife, capture that same animal or area! When you’ve successfully done that, do it again, with another photographer. I’d be willing to bet cold hard money bags of money that the second photographer you follow or are otherwise interested in their work shoots differently than you do, with a different style. Once you’ve knocked out number two, go for a third, and a fourth. After every attempt or measure of success, make it your own. This’ll help you figure out what your style is. You’ll find yourself going back to what you like the most and over time, tweaking it to make it your own.</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/building.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/building-1024x683.jpg?fit=882%2C882" alt="building" /></a></p>

<h3 id="repeat">Repeat.</h3>
<p>So you’ve completed Step Learn. Now what? Do it all over! If only a small amount of time has passed (less than a year), start with Step Do. If it’s been a bit of time or you have the ability to upgrade, do that, with the mindset that you’re upgrading because you can improve yourself with your new gear in ways that you can easily quantify, not just because you like a red band on the end of your lens.</p>

<p>You’ll find this to be an endless cycle that even pros will execute from time to time. If you become a full-time professional, you’ll <em>always</em> be looking for ways to improve and making sure you have everything you need to be as creative and as successful as possible.</p>

<p><em>Author’s Note: I could have made this list stupid long as in reality there are hundreds of different ways to learn or improve.  <a href="http://petapixel.com/2014/01/24/40-tips-take-better-photos/">PetaPixel</a> went into great detail with quotes from professional photographers that’s definitely worth reading.</em></p>

    <p><em>Why it’s not the end of the world and sometimes you just need to suck it up.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ad·ven·ture (n.) — an unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity.I’m a landscape photographer when I’m not studying or working at my day job in IT. My free time is limited but when I have the ability to go on an adventure with my gear I take it. Sometimes, I take a wrong turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With summer coming to an end, I know I only have a few weekends left before fall rolls in and crushes my hopes of a great sunset somewhere new, or awesome weather patterns. See, here in the State of Washington, Fall looks a hell of a lot like this:</p>

<figure id="attachment_128" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-128 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2009-09-27-16.31.04-1024x768.jpg?resize=882%2C662" alt="Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of http://hakuinthemirror.blogspot.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>That freaking sucks. Granted, that photo was taken in Denmark, but Denmark and the Pacific Northwest are pretty close to the same latitudinal line. From October to May, Washington is usually a variation of the above, with a day or two here and there with awesome weather.</p>

<p>My most recent attempt and wrapping up summer on a high note ended in failure. It was frustrating. I was pissed, but at the same time, I had no right to be. There was not a good reason why I was as frustrated as I felt after realizing I took a terribly wrong turn an hour after I made it.</p>

<p>But I was upset, nonetheless. Good thing I had cell service to look up an alternate route.</p>

<p>Oh wait.</p>

<p>I didn’t.</p>

<p>Crap.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>Do I turn around or keep going?</p>

<p>Where the hell am I?</p>

<p>My original goal was to arrive at the Johnston Ridge Observatory on the northwest side of the mountain. Instead, I ended up at the end of a road on the south side of the mountain. Good thing I didn’t blow a tire… or run out of gas.</p>

<p>Here’s where my frustration kicks in. Once I realize I’m nowhere near where I want to be, I lose my cool. I got off Interstate 5 about twenty miles too early and there’s no other way to get around the mountain than by backtracking all the way to said freeway. Not only that, but I’m missing my window that I Wanted to arrive by and unless a miracle happens (which none did), I won’t make it at all.</p>

<p>After turning around and driving back the way I came, in search of a cell signal to verify the sinking suspicion I already had, it hits me that this whole problem is really my fault. I wasted the opportunity. I dragged my wife—who is already very tired from a long day with family—to the middle of nowhere only to turn around and go home with <em>zero</em> to show for it. My wife tries to apologize and while I appreciate her empathy and consideration for how important photography is to me, she did nothing wrong.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-hell-did-we-end-up-here">How The Hell Did We End Up Here?</h3>
<p>Well I’ll tell you. See, when you search for “Mt. St. Helens” on Google Maps, you get <em>exactly</em> what you searched for. It drops a pin smack freaking dab in the middle of the mountain.</p>

<p>But guess what? that’s not where I want to go. See I want to go a bit north, to the end of highway 504 (at the top of the image above). Where did Google Maps decide we need to go to reach out destination? About half-way between the pin on the map and the Swift Resivoir at the bottom of the image. Guess what’s out there?  <strong>Nothing</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t know this was taking place, however, when I asked my wife and adventure co-pilot to get directions to Mt. St. Helens. What I <em>should</em> have asked was to get directions to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, which is exactly where I want to go. Did my wife know that? No. Typically she knows what I tell her because she trusts me and trusts the fact that I know what I’m doing—I’m supposed to be a professional. Reason two why I’m pissed off.</p>

<p>To top it all off, I’m already freakin’ tired, myself, and knowing that I just blew two hours of daylight driving to and from the middle of nowhere makes reason number three.</p>

<p>You can never have too many of those, and that’s the conclusion I’ve come to. Beyond my frustration, there was regular me understanding that making sure the plan is not only in existence but is correct is quite important. Any adventure you take needs to have some sort of plan, unless the goal is merely to wander without purpose. (You can’t wander with purpose, just so we’re clear).</p>

<p>For next time, I know that when I set my route (or my co-pilot in life and in the car, my wonderful wife does it for me), it’s important to make sure that the destination is correct. Everything that happens in the meantime is up in the air and I’m fine with that; that’s what makes an adventure, an adventure.</p>

    <p>In just a week, we pack up and head south. When we moved to the Bay Area, we needed a place to land in short notice. Now, we’re “moving up” in terms of location. Looking forward to being so close to some of the greatest tech companies.</p>

    <p>I’ve started learning Ruby on Rails. One thing I want for myself in the next year or so is to do more software development. As an added bonus, if my career shifted into that type of work, I wouldn’t mind.</p>

<p>I chose Rails because of it’s completeness. It’s not just a language—ruby is the language. It’s a complete framework for building any kind of web app you can think of.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas on web apps I want to build and some of them could turn into real things that could make money. In order to be able to do that, though, I have to have a platform to build upon. I think Rails is it.</p>

    <p>I’m sitting here, looking at my computer screen, and am mesmerized by the desktop background. I feel like I need to be there, instead. Then I wonder… why aren’t I? The trip is only a few hours from the Bay Area to Yosemite and El Capitan, the land structure off of which the latest version of Apple’s Mac OS X is based.</p>

<p>I haven’t gone on enough adventures this year. This last year so far has been crazy. Moving from one end of the left coast to the other took a latent toll on everything. Adjusting has taken some time. I know I used to write a lot more than I do now. I used to have a routine. Now, things just kind of happen.</p>

<p>It’s only October, though. I still have almost three months left in this year to do something and there is always next year, too. New Year’s Resolutions are for chumps, though. If I make any plans, I’m just going to do them. I don’t need some special ritual to convince me I need to do X.</p>

    <p>It’s been hard watching interested parties inquire about my now-retired Macbook Pro. It may just be a computer, but that computer got me through numerious job searches, it travelled a thousand miles, lived in eight homes, and more.</p>

<p>I never thought I’d end up being so sentimental about it. I bought this computer before I met my wife, even. It just goes to show how fast time flies.</p>

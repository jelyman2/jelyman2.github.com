<blockquote>
  <p>It seems like the company is starting to shift its focus, if only a little bit. Instead of forming links people can use to reach new heights in their careers, LinkedIn is encouraging people to actually — get this — talk to the people in their circles.While these companies may be putting Slack “in their crosshairs” doesn’t mean they’re a good shot.</p>

    <p>I received an email just a bit ago of the political donation variety. It’s worth mentioning that a few years ago I guess I ended up on a Scott Walker mailing list. I’m not entirely sure how that happened, but it did.</p>

<p>Before I unsubscribed this morning, I actually read the email and there were two things that stood out to me. First, this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The governor emailed me early this morning specifically asking for your help before the end of the month.Did he, now? Does he even know who I am? Given I haven’t given him a dollar in the history of ever, I wonder why he was so interested in me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mass email was a “forward” of the “email” that Scott Walker “sent” via his “iPhone.” I put all those words in quotes because I don’t think it actually happened.</p>

<p>The second line was amusing, too, and made me chuckle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colleen, I’ve been reviewing grassroots leaders in the 98036 zip code and I don’t have Johnathan’s contact info. Will you please send them a message asking for an urgent contribution before the end of the month? We really need them on our team.Let me know as soon as you hear from Johnathan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>So you’re trying to get money from me by making me believe that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin actually emailed you, citing me, and a zip code I don’t live in, on purpose? Because I’ve given zero dollars, I’m somehow probably good for donating a bunch of cash on short notice?</p>

<p>Pretty weak, but then again, this is American PoliticsTM for you.</p>

    <p>If you asked me how I felt about this topic a few years ago, I would have told you it’s dumb. If you asked me how I felt about becoming a software developer, I would have told you I’d never do it, it’s not something I find interesting. If you told me that we could fast forward three years and my tone would be different, I would have laughed in your face.</p>

<p>Well, here we are, three years later. I’m slowly starting to entertain development-related career paths. It’s an uphill battle, for sure, and it’ll take quite a bit of time to work out, but I see a future ahead of me that I didn’t see before. One thing that’s different about now is where I live. Here in Silicon Valley, software is everything. No one gives two shits about hardware because it’s become so heavily commoditized. The homeless guy pushing his shopping cart down the street right now probably has a DigitalOcean account and is stealthily building his startup.</p>

<p>At no point am I saying “me too” when it comes to making an app or building a thing. I do, however, like building things, and software helps me do that. I can still draw upon my roots in this new space but it’s important for me to be open and ready to experience.</p>

<p>The next year is going to be interesting.</p>

    <p>One thing I never did when I moved my blog to johnathanlyman.com and away from jlyman.net was to add SSL. I had SSL set up and running on jlyman.net purely because of the low cost of entry. At $10/year, basic SSL gives great HTTPS encryption. Privacy is important, and while I don’t take or give sensetive personal information, it’s still a nice thing to have.</p>

<p>I added SSL to this domain last week and am thinking I made a great choice. Every site I fire up from now on will have it. It’s hard to say no at $10 a year… I think I waste more than that on crap I end up throwing away.</p>

    <p>I was thinking about things that entertain me, this morning, and one thing that came to mind was how long I’ve followed the less-than-family-friendly <a href="http://explosm.net">Explosm</a> comic series. In today’s world, we take things quite seriously sometimes, almost too much. It’s good to take a breather once in a while.</p>

    <p>The first numbers for Apple Music are in and it’s an interesting amount. From Marco Cava at <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/05/apple-music-hooks-11-million-trial-members-app-store-has-record-july/31197721/">USA Today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the estimates of 10 million floating around last week were in the right neighborhood. Of course, 11 million users who aren’t actually handing over any money doesn’t really mean much at this point—now Apple has to retain those users after the remaining two months of the free trial are up.I have your answer: make it worth their money. It’s easy to get eleven million people to sign up for something they can get for free with you but have to pay for, elsewhere. The key will be if the <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/02/apple-music-launch-issues/">level of frustration</a> coming <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3camwc/frustrations_of_a_spotify_user_switching_to_apple/">from some</a> has more or less weight than the idea of being able to use a first party app that ties in with your regular iTunes library.</p>

    <p>Apple World Today has a <a href="http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/8/5/it-may-be-time-to-eradicate-flash-from-your-mac-heres-how">quick piece on dumping flash</a>. If you need it, I feel bad for you. If you don’t need it, get rid of it. Adobe Flash has been riddled with holes almost since day one and has never gotten better. It’s 2015 and with the level of intricacy front-end UI frameworks provide, there’s no need for it. Flash needs to go away for good.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, you’ve already dumped it. I keep Google Chrome around just in case and if Flash is an absolute must.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-07-28T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">28 Jul 2015</time>
    <p>I feel like I’ve created this sort of new kind of being. Previously, I had rarely used Vagrant or Docker or anything of the sort, so the idea of being able to craft an on-demand virtual machine with whatever the hell I want inside of it was both exciting and terrifying.</p>

<p>Linux isn’t foreign to me, and neither is the idea of automation, but after being so accustomed to working in a Windows environment against my better judgement for several years, there was a lot of cobweb removal.</p>

<p>Needless to say I could have prevented the aging of my knowledge by staying up to date on every development and deployment technology I could get my hands on. There are, however, only so many hours in the day. Something had to give.</p>

<p>Now I’m paying for that decision as I work on slowing transitioning myself into a more software-development oriented career path. I enjoy ops-y stuff, but I like building things. I like tinkering (hacking?). My boss made a joke today about how involved I get whenever there’s a discussion about minor HTML tweaks to one of our sites.</p>

<p>Hey… I like that shit.</p>

<p>One thing that made it easier for me to get into this new and soon-to-be-awe-inspiring technology is that I had a purpose. There was a clear goal I wanted to meet and beat.</p>

<p>One of our software offerings runs on JIRA. If you’re unfamiliar with the product, it’s a Java-based project management/issue tracking/development/agile tool for organize and keep track of just about anything. Software companies and app development teams are likely the largest consumers of this product. On a regular basis, my team is spinning up and burning down JIRA instances in the never-ending hunt for bug reproduction, walkthroughs, and everyday troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, installing JIRA by hand isn’t fun if you’re running a Linux box. The Windows installer is pretty hands-off but Windows is Windows.</p>

<p>My end goal was to be able to fire up the almighty Vagrant, have it build out a Linux image with a database, JIRA, and be ready to accept input in the browser. I piggy-backed off a couple other like-minded setups I found on GitHub so it only took a couple hours to get it doing what I wanted.</p>

<p>So without further ado, <a href="http://github.com/jelyman2/vagrant-jira-mysql">here’s the link</a>. It’s a work in progress as I’d like to someday have data pre-filled and JIRA pre-installed. I’m not sure how feasible that is given JIRA’s licensing structure. For the uninitiated, the license key is unique and time-based. The key starts to wither away the moment its generated instead of the system stopping working after 30 days from install.</p>

<p>Next week I might try the same with Docker. I’d love to be able to manage a cluster of these types of setups that can be built up and torn down as needed with little overhead. Instead of making the pre-game ritual longer, I want to make it shorter but more enjoyable.</p>

    <p>The point at which I can’t turn back as I pivot my career is approaching. I see it coming, though, which allows me to prepare. Although I’ll never be fully ready, I know I have time to at least pack my suitcase.</p>

    <p>It’s Sunday, and the one thing I enjoy doing on Sunday is watching (American) football. Since it’s still 19 days away from the Seahawk’s first pre-season game–that I might end up missing because I live in California, now, and DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket is both over-priced and only available on DirecTV–I might have to find my way to a Seahawks bar… if they even exist in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>If that doesn’t end up working out, my guess is it’ll be chores and projects… and games. I try to fit in some game time whenever I can because it’s relaxing for me. being able to shut off for a bit and kill some monsters is almost as good as coffee.</p>

    <p>The first numbers for Apple Music are in and it’s an interesting amount. From Marco Cava at <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/05/apple-music-hooks-11-million-trial-members-app-store-has-record-july/31197721/">USA Today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the estimates of 10 million floating around last week were in the right neighborhood. Of course, 11 million users who aren’t actually handing over any money doesn’t really mean much at this point—now Apple has to retain those users after the remaining two months of the free trial are up.I have your answer: make it worth their money. It’s easy to get eleven million people to sign up for something they can get for free with you but have to pay for, elsewhere. The key will be if the <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/02/apple-music-launch-issues/">level of frustration</a> coming <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3camwc/frustrations_of_a_spotify_user_switching_to_apple/">from some</a> has more or less weight than the idea of being able to use a first party app that ties in with your regular iTunes library.</p>

    <p>Apple World Today has a <a href="http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/8/5/it-may-be-time-to-eradicate-flash-from-your-mac-heres-how">quick piece on dumping flash</a>. If you need it, I feel bad for you. If you don’t need it, get rid of it. Adobe Flash has been riddled with holes almost since day one and has never gotten better. It’s 2015 and with the level of intricacy front-end UI frameworks provide, there’s no need for it. Flash needs to go away for good.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, you’ve already dumped it. I keep Google Chrome around just in case and if Flash is an absolute must.</p>

        My First Legitimate Vagrantfile
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-07-28T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">28 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I feel like I’ve created this sort of new kind of being. Previously, I had rarely used Vagrant or Docker or anything of the sort, so the idea of being able to craft an on-demand virtual machine with whatever the hell I want inside of it was both exciting and terrifying.</p>

<p>Linux isn’t foreign to me, and neither is the idea of automation, but after being so accustomed to working in a Windows environment against my better judgement for several years, there was a lot of cobweb removal.</p>

<p>Needless to say I could have prevented the aging of my knowledge by staying up to date on every development and deployment technology I could get my hands on. There are, however, only so many hours in the day. Something had to give.</p>

<p>Now I’m paying for that decision as I work on slowing transitioning myself into a more software-development oriented career path. I enjoy ops-y stuff, but I like building things. I like tinkering (hacking?). My boss made a joke today about how involved I get whenever there’s a discussion about minor HTML tweaks to one of our sites.</p>

<p>Hey… I like that shit.</p>

<p>One thing that made it easier for me to get into this new and soon-to-be-awe-inspiring technology is that I had a purpose. There was a clear goal I wanted to meet and beat.</p>

<p>One of our software offerings runs on JIRA. If you’re unfamiliar with the product, it’s a Java-based project management/issue tracking/development/agile tool for organize and keep track of just about anything. Software companies and app development teams are likely the largest consumers of this product. On a regular basis, my team is spinning up and burning down JIRA instances in the never-ending hunt for bug reproduction, walkthroughs, and everyday troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, installing JIRA by hand isn’t fun if you’re running a Linux box. The Windows installer is pretty hands-off but Windows is Windows.</p>

<p>My end goal was to be able to fire up the almighty Vagrant, have it build out a Linux image with a database, JIRA, and be ready to accept input in the browser. I piggy-backed off a couple other like-minded setups I found on GitHub so it only took a couple hours to get it doing what I wanted.</p>

<p>So without further ado, <a href="http://github.com/jelyman2/vagrant-jira-mysql">here’s the link</a>. It’s a work in progress as I’d like to someday have data pre-filled and JIRA pre-installed. I’m not sure how feasible that is given JIRA’s licensing structure. For the uninitiated, the license key is unique and time-based. The key starts to wither away the moment its generated instead of the system stopping working after 30 days from install.</p>

<p>Next week I might try the same with Docker. I’d love to be able to manage a cluster of these types of setups that can be built up and torn down as needed with little overhead. Instead of making the pre-game ritual longer, I want to make it shorter but more enjoyable.</p>

    <p>The point at which I can’t turn back as I pivot my career is approaching. I see it coming, though, which allows me to prepare. Although I’ll never be fully ready, I know I have time to at least pack my suitcase.</p>

    <p>It’s Sunday, and the one thing I enjoy doing on Sunday is watching (American) football. Since it’s still 19 days away from the Seahawk’s first pre-season game–that I might end up missing because I live in California, now, and DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket is both over-priced and only available on DirecTV–I might have to find my way to a Seahawks bar… if they even exist in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>If that doesn’t end up working out, my guess is it’ll be chores and projects… and games. I try to fit in some game time whenever I can because it’s relaxing for me. being able to shut off for a bit and kill some monsters is almost as good as coffee.</p>

    <p>This weekend, while my wife is out of town, I’m spending time reflecting on my routine to determine what I can do to make the most of my abilities.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of routines, in general, so I know that by establishing one that coincides with a planned week, will help, a lot.</p>

    <p>Ever since I discovered Docker, I’ve been a fan. Trying to explain Docker to the un-initiated is also fun. I describe it like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Docker is like a Lunchable (or bento box). The container of said Lunchable is Docker and the VM it controls. Every section inside the container is each of the apps it runs.I try to tell folks that you use a Virtual Machine if you need to control an entirely specific environment. You use Docker if your interest is just with apps. In this day and age, trying to maintain a fleet of systems or virtual machines can be daunting.</p>

    <p>Ever heard the saying:</p>

  <p>I’m turning over a new leaf?I’d say that, but in this case, the leaf is the same one. This morning I took the time to get back into a morning routine that makes me feel the best.</p>

<p>I’m also working on better planning of my week, as per this video:</p>

    <time datetime="2015-07-21T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">21 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I’ve been internally reflecting on the future of my career quite a bit over the last month or so. One thing I know for sure is where I want my career to head, but what I’m not 100% sure about is how to get there.</p>

<p>My overall plan is to pivot into software development. I enjoy solving technical puzzles, fixing things, and making things, all of which can be accomplished with great detail and satisfaction in software development. At this time I haven’t picked a single language or group of languages to stick to and become an expert in. I feel that’ll come within the next few months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have to figure out how to best build up these new skills I require while still maintaining my current day job, which I don’t dislike.</p>

    <p>It’s pretty much impossible to design a site without CSS these days. It controls everything. CSS has a hand in so many visual aspects of a site that it can get daunting to keep track of it all or figure out how to tweak it just a certain way. I came up with a list of various web-based CSS tools that can assist any designer in their front-end development quest. If there’s something I missed, please add it to the comments!</p>

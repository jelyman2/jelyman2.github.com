    <p>This is something I’ve been waiting to see for a long time. As you’re aware, I’ve been using a four year old Macbook Pro for quite some time (placed the order in June 2011) and today I’ve finally made the upgrade to a 2015 of the same make and model.</p>

<p>The one thing I was excited to see the most above all else is the disk I/O speeds.</p>

<p>Let’s compare…</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-02-16.42.35.png"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screenshot-2015-10-02-16.42.35.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-10-02 16.42.35" /><br />
</a></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-02-at-4.40.41-PM-952x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-10-02 at 4.40.41 PM" /></p>

<p>Big difference, eh? The former is a SATA 6Gb SSD (Toshiba 128GB) and the latter is a PCI-e SSD (256GB). My how times change.</p>

    <p>We’re going to see <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_martian/">The Martian</a> tomorrow evening. I’m super stoked. I consumed the audiobook via <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Martian-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG">Audible</a> about eight months ago and have wished for a movie ever since.</p>

<p>My only complaint: it’s not in <a href="http://imax.com">IMAX</a>. Space movies need IMAX. C’mon Ridley Scott.</p>

    <p>I was combing Rotten Tomatoes’ reviews of The Martian, and one popped out at me as one of those reviews that make it seem like the reviewer didn’t actually watch the movie and or didn’t know there was a book…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2015/10/walk-visual-magic-one-few-films-which-3d-justified">Ryan Gibley</a> from <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2015/10/walk-visual-magic-one-few-films-which-3d-justified">The Statesman</a> said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the while, he is keeping a video diary in which he is sassy (“In your face, Neil Armstrong!”) as he outlines every step of his plan to make contact with Planet Earth. It’s almost as if he knows he’s a character in a movie.What?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone who read the book, I can tell you Matt Damon’s character, Mark Watney, is like this in the book, too.</p>

    <p>So it’s finally happening. After over four years—52 months to be exact—my Early-2011-era Macbook Pro is being retired. In its place is going a new Macbook Pro of the same size.</p>

<p>I spent quite a bit of time thinking about what would replace my daily workhorse. I’ve put this system through the ringer and it’s held up amazingly well. Through all the days I’ve toted it to an office to use instead of my work machine (lol Windows) and the number of times most other laptops would have given up the ghost, my Mac has held up. It’s seen a total of five versions of OS X, now, including the latest, El Capitan. I started with OS X Snow Leopard and rocked that for a few months.</p>

<p>I still vaguely remember what it was like to pay for operating system upgrades, although that memory is quickly fleeting. I used to think paying $30 for an upgrade was miles better than the high prices of Windows. Now, I think $30 is too much and am not sure what I would do if Apple started charging, again.</p>

<p>My new system arrives tomorrow courtesy of UPS and I’m looking forward to one thing more than faster this and that: the weight. I’ve gotten used to the near six pounds that my current Macbook Pro weighs, but the Mid-2015 model clocks in at 4.5. It might not seem that much lighter, but tied in with the size difference, it adds up.</p>

<p>Most of all, though, I’m looking forward to the external monitor support. The unit I purchased only has integrated graphics but those integraphics (new word) can drive two 4K monitors plus the built-in display at the same time. Talk about screen real estate. Sure it’s not going to hold up well for gaming, but I didn’t guy it for that.</p>

<p>Friday can’t come soon enough (tomorrow?). See you then! I’m sure I’ll have things to share about my new, fancy laptop this weekend.</p>

    <p>So I’ve been experimenting with brewing my own coffee like the ways of the eskimos: cold.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe they brewed their coffee hot. I’m just guessing.</p>

<p>I know this whole ‘small-batch’ trend is quite invariably hipster and I’m certainly one of the last people to jump on that bandwagon, but sometimes one just has to concede when another makes superior coffee.</p>

<p>Plus I knew it went mainstream when Starbucks started offering it.</p>

<p>So what is this cold-brew coffee I speak of and why is it so much better?Let me keep it simple, since I don’t want to bore you with all the sicence-y stuff.</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup.jpg"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup-1024x683.jpg" alt="boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup" /></a></p>

<p>Instead of running hot water through ground coffee, you let ground coffee “seep” in a bucket/pitcher/container of cool water for 12-24 hours. Once it’s sat and stewed in its own substance, filter out the grounds. I use a large mixing bowl as the catch device. Cheesecloth works well for filtering so long as you kept your grounds coarse. If it’s fine powder, you might be better off with a coffee filter (although the filtering process will take much longer).</p>

<p>My mixture is roughly 3.5 to 4 cups of grounds per one gallon of cold tap water. I don’t pack the grounds into the measuring cup. You’ll need about 1/3 to 1/2 lb of ground coffee beans to make this happen. In my home, one gallon of the liquid energy lasts through about six 20-oz cups with ice filled about half way. For my wife and I, that’s three days. We add a splash of sweet-cream creamer (two splashes for me, I like it sweet and ass kicking at the same time) and it’s done. We used to use simple syrup like the coffee shops but at $5 per 12oz bottle, I was using 1/3 the bottle per one gallon of coffee.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how the coffee chains make it but this is my process.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice about the flavor is it’s a lot richer, but not as bitter. When we used to brew hot coffee, we’d get light roast beans for the least bitterness possible. Now, we use whatever because the flavor profile seems to be more consistent and the level of bitterness just isn’t there in the cold coffee.</p>

<p>It’s also a lot stronger. That hot liquid in your coffee maker has seconds with the grounds. We’re giving the liquid hours to really make something special out of their time together. If I skip breakfast, I’m taking it to 11 within an hour or two.</p>

<p>When it comes to price, there’s no question on how much cheaper this process is.</p>

<p>At Starbucks, it’s $3.55 plus tax for a 20-oz cold-brew iced coffee.</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup.jpg"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup-1024x508.jpg" alt="boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup" /></a></p>

<p>By my math and based on my costs, it’s running us $2.75 to $3.00 for one gallon of cold-brew iced coffee, or $0.42 to $0.47 per 20-oz cup.</p>

<p>Obviously ice plays a factor in all this and the cost varies but there’s no doubting that we’re saving quite a bit of money in exchange for roughly 20 minutes of my day (10 in the beginning to grind and 10 to filter at the end).</p>

<p>Is it worth it? Totally. One thing I’d do differently, though is get some sort of pitcher that has a core to keep the grounds in that can be pulled out and emptied. I’m facing cheesecloth damage and stray grounds-in-my-brew issues. Pitchers like this sell for $20 on Amazon. Also worth the purchase, in my opinion.</p>

<p> </p>

    <p>David Smith (also known as “Underscore David Smith”) dropped Sleep++, an Apple Watch app that allows you to track your sleep a la Fitbit and others. The key here is needing to keep your watch on all the time. So how do you do it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>TL/DR</em> is to charge your Apple Watch in the morning while you get ready for your day (take a shower, get dressed, etc) and then again in the evening while you get ready for bed (brush teeth, put on pajamas, etc). Then put your Apple Watch in Airplane Mode while you sleep.Read more about this process <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/21/how-to-wear-your-apple-watch-24-slash-7/">over on his blog</a>.</p>

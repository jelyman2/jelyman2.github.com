    <p>I’m skeptical about <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/photos-preview/">Photos for Mac</a>. The last time Apple made a photo editing product, no one used it (Aperture). I’m sure it’ll look best and work best on the highest end Macs with the best screens (Retina iMac).</p>

<p>Either way. I’ll probably give it a shot.</p>

        The Desire to Write

    <p>My desire to write continues to grow. When I first start at the beginning of the year, I was writing once a day, and I felt like that wouldn’t be sustainable so I <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart" title="Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year">told myself</a> I would write a few times a week. Turns out, I enjoy it a lot more than I thought I did. Writing has given me an opportunity to not just put my thoughts on digital paper and share with the world, but be able to look back at things that happened over the last day or so and reflect on them if I feel said topics are important. I have a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/311/desk-overview" title="Just Sit Down and Write with Desk">great app</a> to write with, and fortunately my wife support me. It’s hard to say if I’d ever make it a career but as it stands right now, I could write about stuff for hours.</p>

<p>Who knows what 2015 will hold. The summer will bring a whole host of <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/246/scared-to-act" title="Scared to Act">new changes and new experiences</a> for my family and I’m excited and terrified, but mostly excited.</p>

    <p>From out of the Ashes of The Unofficial Apple Weblog comes Apple World.Today and <a href="http://appleworld.today">it looks to be great</a>.</p>

<p>I’m glad to see some of the former editors firing up another site and continuing the never ending task of brining us great Apple news. Steve Sande, Dave Caolo, and Kelly Hodgkins are  steering the new ship and hope to bring us some great content.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our goal with Apple World Today is to pick up where TUAW left off as a source of news and reviews. But we want to take the site to you, the readers, by offering discussion forums (are we crazy to do this?), podcasts, and more video content. Wherever possible, we want to get our audience engaged by joining with us in online and live on-the-air discussions.Sweet.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>AWT is a relative baby in the world of blogging about that company from Cupertino, and as such you can expect us to poop ourselves on a regular basis as we get used to our new home.I hope the rough analogies to new, non-house-trained pets don’t continue, though. <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

    <p>A few people have asked what music I listen to in the morning while I’m mentally prepping for my day (by writing).</p>

<p>Before I answer, I want to disclose that my tastes change from time to time, so the genres of music listed below might not be similar in any way. What you see is just want I’m listening to right now, courtesy of Spotify.</p>

<h2 id="classical">Classical</h2>
<p>I only have one classical playlist I listen to, and it works well for me.</p>

<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:spotify:playlist:1oXl0OHlE1mPDChMa8Y0Ax" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="acoustic">Acoustic</h2>
<p>I dabble with acoustic music, too, just as I do classical. Instrumental music, I feel, is the best uber-genre of music when trying to concentrate or focus because then words someone is saying or singing don’t distract. I’m easily distracted. It’s not a super long playlist so I don’t listen to it all the time. The last thing I need is monotony.</p>

<h2 id="electronic">Electronic</h2>
<p>A few electronic playlists make the cut for my morning rituals. I have to be careful that there aren’t too many songs that have distinct beats that can be jarring.</p>

        The Best Way I Make Life Changes

    <p>Some may say it takes time to change a habit, and they’d probably be right. From what I’ve read, it takes upwards of <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/02/how-long-it-takes-to-form-a-new-habit/">three weeks</a> to fully break a habit. </p>

<p>That hasn’t stopped me from going cold turkey.</p>

<p>When I started blogging every back in January, I decided I was going to do it in the morning, before I left for work, since not all of us have time to focus when we get home in the evening. The early mornings (4-5:30am) are typically the quietest around my house so it made sense.</p>

<p>One thing I did to get my morning routine to support this new style of getting with the program Monday-Friday was to adjust my sleeping habits. Based on the typical 90 minute sleep cycle, I figured out when I could reasonably go to bed and be able to wake at around the same time every morning. This meant that overall I would get less sleep, but from what I can tell so far, waking up at the right time versus the last minute has helped a lot. </p>

<p>What I really changed around cold turkey was my morning routine as a whole. I made the decision to do things differently and just went with them. As much as I wanted to sleep in, I was more motivated by not having to rush around in the morning. As I write this, I look at the clock and can tell I would still be asleep if I hadn’t started this. </p>

<p>It’s really made things better for me as I start my day. I don’t feel as crappy and want to take as big of a nap at 10am.</p>

<p>But back to the cold turkey thing. </p>

<p>I didn’t gradually work myself up to waking up an hour to 90 minutes earlier every day. I just did it. I rolled back my alarm clock and that was that. No dancing around the issue. If I was going to do it, I might as well do all of it and get used to it right away.</p>

<p>So here we are.</p>

<p>It might take three weeks to break a habit, but the desire to improve overwhelms that if one genuinely wants to do it.</p>

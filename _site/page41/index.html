—TechCrunchWell duh. One doesn’t need Facebook to get into the mindset of seeing another’s happiness and wish it was their own.

        Where I Get My Stock Photos
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-02-04T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</time>

    <p>One would think that because I’m a photographer in some capacity that I would take all of my own photos. Let me tell you, that’s certainly not the case. One cannot craft a particular scene in a heartbeat with just enough time to post it to a blog. Good luck with that. </p>

<p>Instead, I use a lot of creative-commons based stock photography. I thought I’d put together a list of sites I source my imagery from in hopes that it helps you in your journey to finding great images for your site.</p>

<p>I have several primary sources I rotate through, depending on what time of the week it is. Most of these sites only update once a week or month with a new “pack” of images.</p>

<h2 id="death-to-the-stock-photo">﻿Death to the Stock Photo</h2>
<p><a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com">DTTSP</a> has two models for delivering photos: free and premium. The free model allows you to receive photos in your email every month in a pack of about ten. They’re high quality images, large enough to print, even, if you so desired. With their premium model, you can get access to their whole archive, not just most recent images for $10 a month. I can’t say that about any big stock photo agency.</p>

<h2 id="unsplash">﻿Unsplash</h2>
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com">A side project</a> by the visual design agency Crew, you’re granted ten new photos every ten days to do whatever you want with. You can view their past images by scrolling and all are was to download right from the site, no membership or sign-up forms required. The images and their themes vary from week to week so don’t hesitate to scroll down a ways and get into past months’ photos.</p>

<h2 id="raumrot">﻿Raumrot</h2>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.raumrot.com/10/">this site</a> because they have categories. A lot of them feel a bit hipster in style but that’s all the rage now from what the kids tell me. Most if not all of their images are hosted on flicker so they’re easy to download. All they ask is a bit of attribution.</p>

<h2 id="little-visuals">﻿Little Visuals</h2>
<p>While not as active anymore as some of the others, <a href="http://littlevisuals.co">their archive</a> is good. They’re not my first choice anymore since they don’t seem to be updating the site with new images, but their archives have a gem once in a while.</p>

<h2 id="new-old-stock">﻿New Old Stock﻿</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://nos.twnsnd.co">great place</a> for older images from the 1920s-1950s, and surrounding time periods. It’s amazing to look at some of these images as they’re genuinely pieces of history. </p>

    <p>Remember yesterday when I mentioned that AdBlock Plus was allowing companies to pay their way through the blocks to users? Turns out, that list is bigger than I led on. In fact, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/over-300-businesses-now-whitelisted-on-adblock-plus-10-pay-to-play/">it’s down right stupid long</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an e-mail to Ars, AdBlock Plus Communications Manager Ben Williams wrote that currently, the browser extension has granted a pass to “over 300 sites/entities” out of “over 1,500 applicants” to the company’s whitelist.Damn. Remind me again the point of AdBlock Plus?</p>

    <p>The words “vacate” and “vacation” seem to have two very different connotations in our mind. Looking at news articles tells us just that.</p>

<p><strong>Vacate:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Residents Forced To Vacate From Historic, Problem-Plagued Roseville Building— <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/02/01/residents-forced-to-vacate-from-historic-problem-plagued-roseville-building/">CBS13 Sacramento</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Vacation:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He Saved For Months To Buy His Wife A Dream Vacation. Her Happy Tears Say It All— <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/02/man-surprises-wife-vacation-video_n_6595506.html">Huffington Post</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>See what I mean? It’s actually a bit difficult to find an article about someone vacating their location and heading to Hawai’i, Milan, or Costa Rica.</p>

    <p>Today is the last day for The Unofficial Apple Weblog. TUAW has been a staple in keeping up with the latest Apple news, products and happenings. The site was always a go-to of mine to keep up to date on rumors, and it did its job well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TUAW, for lots of reasons beyond our control, has no future, but Apple’s burns brightly. It’s been great writing about these growing technologies, and seeing and testing apps — some that were great and some that fell short. All of us here tried to tell the story of Apple and its offspring of hardware and software companies and tell it straight; the good along with the sometimes ugly.— <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2015/02/02/some-final-thoughts/">Mel Martin</a>, TUAW</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re unsure of what that first sentence means let me translate: “TUAW doesn’t write enough fluff. Engadget and TechCrunch do. AOL wants to keep them because fluff pieces make more ad dollars. Without ad dollars, AOL will we all die.”</p>

<p>I can’t help but think that’s why TUAW and coincidentally, Joystiq are taking their final ride today and heading out to pasture. While the revolution of digital media killed off many a good magazine (read: Macworld, Cat Fancy), having a digital publication that people actually enjoy murdered quietly is tough, too. I’m sure TC and Engadget will have plenty of space for the staff from TUAW and Joystiq, but they’re just not the same. Both are end-all-be-all properties that try to cater to everyone and in turn they lose a sliver of their credibility as being the authority on specific things. I wouldn’t trust my local Wal-Mart with high-nor would I trust Radio Shack, either—and I think it’s hard to put faith into a site that tries to pull in 20-somethings for gadget news and then turn around and write about a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/mysecretluxury-is-a-concierge-service-for-romance-love-potentially-sex/">concierge sex service</a>. It never ended there, don’t even get me started on why <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/">a porn site</a> that really wasn’t that special was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/">newsworthy</a>.</p>

<p>To each their own, I guess. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have <a href="http://imore.com">iMore</a>, <a href="http://9to5mac.com">9to5Mac</a>, and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">ArsTechnica</a> to go read.</p>

    <p>It’s not going to change anything. I follow McDonalds on Facebook. A lot of people do. I do it because I like McDonalds. I eat it more than I should but that’s a different story altogether. I find it fascinating that people troll McDonald’s Facebook page almost without reprieve.</p>

<p>Take a look at the below series of “questions” asked by commenters of a post McDonalds made about their eggs:</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-14-10.07.12.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Consume those mind-numbing questions and let’s discuss.</p>

<p><strong>#1. Pink Slime</strong></p>

<p>This comes up every time. There’s a turd bucket out there who insists they’re right no matter what and asks the company <em>yet again</em> if they use Pink Slime in their meat. Let’s not forget this whole thing was discussed recently in great detail, already. </p>

<p><strong>#2. Sauce on Bagel</strong></p>

<p>If you know how to look up ingredients for anything, you could probably figure this one out on your own which is a great transition into the third comment. I’ll admit not everyone thinks about that, but it’s 2015 and clearly they have Internet access. I’m not one to give the benefit of the doubt if it’s not warranted.</p>

<p><strong>#3. French Fry Ingredients</strong></p>

<p>Someone’s never made french fries in stupid large volumes before. Someone’s never made french fries on their own before, period, I’m guessing. It requires a few extra ingredients to execute such tasks on the scale McDonalds needs. This was something they discussed in great detail already, too. Someone wasn’t present for that, it seems.</p>

<p><strong>#4. Egg McMuffin</strong></p>

<p>Someone goes to a crappy restaurant. Probably a good idea to change? Product support on a company’s Facebook page is the best kind there is, though.</p>

<p><strong>#5. Egg Beaters</strong></p>

<p>Someone didn’t read. Moving on.</p>

<p><strong>#6. More Egg Beaters</strong></p>

<p>One likely disgruntled employee is obviously right. Reading must really not be a thing, anymore.</p>

<p>It pretty clearly sounds like I’m a McDonalds supporter. And to an extent, I might be, as much as I enjoy eating their food. I’m also a supporter of not being stupid. Clearly trolling is the best tactic to making sure a company fails. I won’t ever say McDonalds is even remotely good for you, but things really have to be done a certain way in order to be made and run on the scale that McDonalds operates. </p>

<p>People will disagree with me, and that’s fine. I don’t care. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.</p>

    <p>I brought my computer with me on the bus this morning to see if I could write while riding and came to one horrible conclusion. It’s impossible. One thing bus manufacturers haven’t thought about it making enough space for people to do work comfortably. What’s up with that? Then there’s those crazy side-facing seats. I unfortunately was limited to one of those for a place to sit, if I didn’t want to share with someone and have them look over my shoulder. Aside: don’t think the person next to you isn’t glancing down at your screen. I’m talking to you, co-workers who work for one of the biggest software companies in the world.</p>

<p>The above paragraph was written solely while riding public transportation. As it turns out, it’s incredibly hard to do. The seats are too close together. Maybe I have too big of a computer. Perhaps wanting to have a decently-sized keyboard and a good screen to look at is too much to ask. I should be using an iPad these days, right? Or better yet, just blogging on my phone because that’s what the kids do.</p>

<p>Whatever. I want to use my computer. There’s not much else to this post besides me complaining that I can’t blog on the bus the way I want to. I should probably just stick to blogging at my desk. I seem to enjoy it much more, there. Plus, there’s no one looking over my shoulder as I type. (fact: big pet peeve)</p>

    <p>Looking back on old posts isn’t really something that I do on a regular basis. Once I’m all set and posting my words, that’s pretty much it. I have a good reason, though. If I started going back and reviewing my past posts, I feel like I might end up second guessing my work before I post it in the first place.</p>

<p>There’s one time I go back and review that doesn’t have to do with copy editing. When I feel like formatting suffered or something just didn’t turn out right, then I’ll for sure review it. If I’m talking about a particular topic and I find a link to share after the fact, I might link it in the post later.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the first time around is usually the most genuine with writing, the words we say, or any mixture of the two. I try to keep it that way as much as possible.</p>

    <p>From <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-office-online-update-improves-onedrive-saving-pdf-printing/">ZDNet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The update’s file management improvements include the ability to save a copy of a file to OneDrive and select a new location in different folders to store the document. … Microsoft has added a Save As option, where the user can choose from Save As, Rename, Download a Copy, or Download as a PDF.There’s now a one click option to save files to OneDrive via a new Add to OneDrive button on the toolbar for Excel,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft has also tidied up the start page to make it faster to begin editing a document.</p>

<p>Bing also gets promoted via the Tell Me function in Help.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>I like Office, I really do. it’s hard to find a really good alternative these days. Apple’s offerings were neutered a couple years ago, and the open source alternatives just seem janky.</p>

<p>However, one could print to PDF with Chrome for like years, now.</p>

  <p>Yesterday a new website and database launched called NoFlyZone.org, which invites people to enter their home address to prevent amateur drone pilots from zooming over their property, GoPro running. The database is maintained by a team of 10 people based in El Segundo, California, and led by Ben Marcus, a private pilot and drone operator.I have a pretty good idea what organizations won’t be using this database.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest “duh” technologies that we got in the last year or two was the phone kill switch. Lose your phone? Nuke it from orbit. Phone stolen? Nuke it from orbit. Jealous ex texting you at 3am? If you know their Apple ID password, nuke it from orbit.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0LF09520150211?irpc=932">Reuters</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thefts involving smartphones have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing “kill switches” that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen, authorities said on Tuesday.That’s great. Now if only there was some way to educate the remaining group of individuals responsible for stealing phones anyway.</p>

    <p>I read some powerful words, yesterday, and I knew right away they were worth discussing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you think, so shall you become. <br />
– UnknownIt’s powerful stuff but the words speak a simple message. We’re surrounded my many different influences that can shape our thoughts and actions, but the biggest influence is ourselves. We’re the ones that make the final decision on whether to act a certain way, and those decisions are based on the thoughts we have. Having a positive mind leads to leading a positive life, but one cannot have the latter without the former. It cannot be expected that by being negative and pessimistic on the inside will still allow for an upbeat life on the outside. Take care of yourself by taking care of where your head is at. It’s the first and biggest step to improving anything and everything else around you.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen such a great <a href="http://vimeo.com/118471437">story about a bridge</a>? Neither have I. At roughly ten minutes in length, Lightning Boy Studio comes at us with a great animated tale with no speaking on two men who were determined to fix or rebuild a bridge that had fallen away into a vast canyon. A couple years ago, this video was a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1662185920/le-gouffre-animated-short-film">Kickstarter campaign</a> that passed its goal by 5x. Let’s not forget there are a few feels, too.</p>

    <p>I’m skeptical about <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/photos-preview/">Photos for Mac</a>. The last time Apple made a photo editing product, no one used it (Aperture). I’m sure it’ll look best and work best on the highest end Macs with the best screens (Retina iMac).</p>

<p>Either way. I’ll probably give it a shot.</p>

    <p>I’ve been internally reflecting on the future of my career quite a bit over the last month or so. One thing I know for sure is where I want my career to head, but what I’m not 100% sure about is how to get there.</p>

<p>My overall plan is to pivot into software development. I enjoy solving technical puzzles, fixing things, and making things, all of which can be accomplished with great detail and satisfaction in software development. At this time I haven’t picked a single language or group of languages to stick to and become an expert in. I feel that’ll come within the next few months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have to figure out how to best build up these new skills I require while still maintaining my current day job, which I don’t dislike.</p>

    <p>It’s pretty much impossible to design a site without CSS these days. It controls everything. CSS has a hand in so many visual aspects of a site that it can get daunting to keep track of it all or figure out how to tweak it just a certain way. I came up with a list of various web-based CSS tools that can assist any designer in their front-end development quest. If there’s something I missed, please add it to the comments!</p>

        A Post I Wrote with Writed
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-07-09T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">09 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I’m always on the lookout for new and interesting apps that make the desktop writing experience more enjoyable. I’m a big fan of <a href="http://desk.pm">Desk</a> and <a href="http://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> and wondered what other kinds of markdown-based writing tools were out there.</p>

<p>A quick Google search turned up more than a few and I only had time to talk about one, tonight, so I picked a free entry in the space, <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a believer of having a good-quality, distraction-free writing environment to craft stories, blog posts, news articles, and even school papers*, one of the biggest things to me is the ability to go full-on distraction-free mode and be able to just write, without anything else getting in the way. Writed does the full-screen writing mode well with several styles to choose from. Since it was night when I wrote this, I found it suitable to sit by a lamp at my desk and use the Night theme. The contrast is good and I’m not struggling to see. Plus, if I darken the brightness of my screen, the dark grey background becomes almost black, and the words still pop.</p>

<h3 id="distraction-free">99% Distraction Free</h3>
<p>A word and character counter sit at the bottom of the screen, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to make that bar disappear, so strictly speaking, I’m not operating in full distraction-free mode like my favorites would alow me to do, but we’re close. To be honest, I like to see the numbers from time to time because it feels like I’m increasing some magical word score and I’m shooting for a high score. I have this odd fascination with things that allow me to attain exceedingly high scores with no real reward at the end but an even higher score.</p>

<h3 id="basic-markdown-support">Basic Markdown Support</h3>
<p>Writed does markdown writing well with it’s backtick ( ` ) code support, as well as proper emphasis with single and double-underscore and -asterisk support. Headers and code blocks work fine, as well as blockquoting with greater-than carats ( the &gt; symbol).</p>

<p>If I was going to chang anything about this application, I’d only do one thing: make the bottom bar something I can hide. Given that it’s a slightly different color in the theme, it stands out from the rest of the editing space and is just a smidge distracting. Other than that, I like <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a> and for the price of FREE with a couple optional in-app purchases, it’s super hard to say no to such an app that gets the basic markdown-centric-distraction-limited-writing-space job done.</p>

    <p>This is something I never knew existed. The <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> team posted <a href="https://medium.com/the-story/custom-domains-for-publications-8cb161d9651">this article</a> back in March about their limited beta launch of custom domains for publications that use Medium as a publishing platform.</p>

<p>The article isn’t super detailed about the whole process and there’s only a few publications on board as of the March 12, 2015 story, but this is something I’ve been wanting to see from Medium for a long time. Their publishing platform is awesome. It’s super easy to use and is formatted very well for long-form articles and stories that feature big and beautiful imagery.</p>

<p>My only hope is that they extend this to everyone at some point in time.</p>

        After 200 Posts&#8230; What&#8217;s Next?

    <time datetime="2015-07-09T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">09 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I published my 200th blog post for the year, just <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed">a bit ago</a>, with a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed">review</a> of the free markdown editing app <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a>. It’s crazy to think that starting in <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/">January</a>, up until today, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/">July 9th</a>, I’ve written 200 blog posts (with this one being #201).</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure what the next 200 posts will hold, but I hope to be able to get them in before the end of the year. There’s a tad less than 1/2 of the calendar year to go so I’m looking at quite a challenge, but I was able to start strong in the beginning of the year so there’s no excuse why I can’t sit down and bust out 200 different things I want to talk about.</p>

<p>I have a lot on my mind.</p>

        Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-07-08T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">08 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I never thought I’d end up being a fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise. I haven’t so much as played any of the past titles including the ever popular Skyrim.</p>

<p>Then last weekend, while I was scrolling through the PlayStation Store on my PlayStation 4, I came across Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited. I was naturally a bit curious as I hadn’t followed the franchise much and wanted to know more about this unknown-to-me installment.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it wasn’t a new installment at all so much as it was an all-access pass to the Elder Scrolls Online world. Previously, people had to pay monthly for the game like those who play World of Warcraft and MMOs like it. Having a one-time fee of $60 seemed much more appealing to someone like me that might pick it up and put it down here and there and go a significant while without playing.</p>

<p>The last thing I wanted to do at this point in my gaming career (if you can call it that) was to end up spending $15-20 a month on a game that I only play for a few hours a week. The total cost of ownership would be much lower at this single price point, even at the same duration of play per month.</p>

<p>So I caved and bought it. Since it was a digital purchase, I more or less bought rights to play it, but that’s just semantics. I really thought I would be able to pick it up and start playing that same night. As it turns out, that wasn’t quite the case.</p>

<p>At almost 36GB for the main game and 18GB for the “update” to said game, I was in for a wait. A 55GB game is nothing to sneeze and and that gave me hope there would be a lot of content and a lot of places to explore.</p>

<p>The next day, long after it downloaded, I fired it up and jumped into the fray. This comes after spending a few hours the night before watching YouTube videos to partly learn about what’s going on and partly secretly justify my (probably) non-refundable purchase.</p>

<p>First impressions are important, and I wasn’t really disappointed. The visuals are on par with what I would expect from a current-generation game console at steady frame rates. The story is as fantasy as it can get. The interface took some getting used to as this is my first foray into the console-MMO space. Quest markers were the hardest parts to get down.</p>

<p>After several hours, I was hooked, however, and am glad I made the purchase. So far, I’ve sunk roughly 10 hours into the game and have just scratched the surface. I look forward to continuing my digital adventures with my character named NathanielIronbow. Cheesy, I know.</p>

    <p>I’m not sure why I didn’t discover this earlier. My excitement when Spotify came to the PlayStation 4 was moderate and I’ve been using Spotify as an all-but-replacement for my rotting Apple iTunes (now Apple Music) library for some time.</p>

<p>One thing I never put together until today is that I can control what’s playing on my PlayStation 4 via Spotify on my Mac.</p>

<p>I’m sure this isn’t news to a lot of people, but it is to me, so you know what…?</p>

<p>…mind blown.</p>

    <p><a href="http://stackedit.io">StackEdit</a> is a in-browser markdown editor that takes on the likes of iA Writer and GitHub Pages in terms of its capability. If you’re a fan of Markdown in even the least bit, it’ll be easy for StackEdit to be your go to text editor.</p>

<p>The interface window features the basic text editor and styling controls like text format, linking, inserting code and images, and creating lists. In fact, it’s so easy to pick up, you really don’t need any instructions.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-30-15.57.20.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-30-15.57.20.png?resize=882%2C559" alt="Screenshot 2015-06-30 15.57.20" /></a></p>

<p>The dual pane editor/preview layout is like that of the NodeJS-powered Ghost blog platform. Everything you type shows up in real time on the right-hand side of the screen in proper format. When you’re done, you can sync your texts to Dropbox or Google Drive, save them in the editor, and even push them to various end points including Blogger, WordPress, GitHub, Tumblr, and an SSH server if you have your own static site platform you wish to use.</p>

<p>What’s really cool? If you have a CouchDB instance, it’ll push straight to it. Pretty nifty.</p>

<p>Give <a href="http://stackedit.io">StackEdit</a> a try. I think you’ll like it.</p>

        A Kitematic Overview
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-06-27T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">27 Jun 2015</time>

    <p>I have only recently started tinkering with Docker when I made a brief attempt at getting Discourse running on my server. What started out as me being quite frustrated with my lack of SMTP knowledge ended in my admittance that a pre-packaged setup would be much easier, and indeed it was.</p>

<p>Docker is good for that. Docker’s purpose is to allow swift and efficient deployment and management of applications that reside in their own containers. Think of a cargo ship. Each one of those containers can be its own app that runs exclusively in its own box/bubble/container/virtual world and on the outside Docker and the system it runs on maintains structural integrity so each container can keep running.</p>

<p>If you’re relatively new to Docker like I am, you’ll probably be wondering how easy it is to get started.</p>

<p>There are two routes: the command line route and the GUI route. Today I’m going to show off the GUI route by way of an app called Kitematic.</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-27-16.02.42.png"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-27-16.02.42.png?resize=882%2C570" alt="Screenshot 2015-06-27 16.02.42" /></a></p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of Kitematic, in my opinion, is to bridge the gap that’s created by the learning curve created by not being fully aware of how to interact with Docker on the command line.</p>

<p>Deploying an image is dirt simple. The UI presents you with a searchable area in which you can comb the Docker Hub. One click is all it takes to create an instance of the application you’re looking to install.</p>

<p>The actual deployment time will depend on your Internet connection speed because the image has to be downloaded. The larger the application, the longer it’ll take to deploy, install, and configure, so keep that in mind.</p>

<h3 id="deployment-tests">Deployment Tests</h3>
<p>Here are a few examples of apps I downloaded and how long they took from the moment I clicked the Create button to the moment they were ready to go. These incredibly non-scientific numbers come from my 2011 Macbook Pro with a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB of RAM, and the images being stored and run on an SSD. I also used the most popular choices for each of these images, including recommended ones if they were available. Each of the image were downloaded on a 125mbps Internet connection and the timing below includes that.</p>

      <td>I obviously want to stress that the above numbers are essentially me using a stopwatch and watching the process take place. When it came to MySQL, it never fully initialized and I was unable to determine its progress after about 30 seconds. I couldn’t connect to the service and the logs weren’t displaying anything. It’s possible that I just got a bad run and re-doing it could have fixed my issue. YMMV.</td>

<p>If you plan on running Kitematic a lot, you’ll want to make sure you can reserve at least 2GB of RAM for the VirtualBox VM it runs in the background. Also, check Kitematic’s settings and check the box to clean up the VM on closure if you’re on a battery-powered system. It’ll take a bit of extra time on boot but it’ll save your battery when you’re not using it, for sure.</p>

<p>I do believe it’s prudent to point out that if you choose the delete-on-closure option, you might find yourself with a VM that can’t fetch an IP address when you re-start Kitematic. This was the case 100% of the time I restarted Kitematic after killing VirtualBox on Kitematic’s closure.</p>

<h3 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>So here’s where I tell you if it’s worth it. In short, completely. For people like me that just want to get things done and move on with my day and not have to deal with the command line all the time, this is a boon. If you’re a die-hard command line junkie that thrives on typos and mashing away at the keyboard, go do it the regular, old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Kitematic is free to use and is in Beta. It might be a bit rough around the edges, and may not work very well on Windows. I tried running the JIRA install on Windows and it failed every time.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to break into Docker and the idea of containered apps, this is your vice.</p>

    <p>TAKE IT FROM ME.</p>

<p>It’s easy to give advice. It’s actually way too easy. Standing on the outside, looking in, it’s easy to observe, to judge. We compare someone and the pieces that make them whole to ourselves and our own components.</p>

<p>One thing we fail to do all too often is heed our own advice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do as I say, not as I do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those words were likely spoken by every parent to ever exist even so far as millennia past. We secretly swear but tell our children that such acts are bad. We teach that good [religious group] should regularly [reglion-based activity] but we fail to even keep par with the course.</p>

<p>I can sit here in front of my screen and bang on the keyboard in an attempt to preach to you about how you should <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/life-changes/">create better habits</a> and how you should do that extra good thing every day and how you should <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/naturebox/">stop shoveling shit</a> for food into your grub hole every day.</p>

<p>I’d be a damn hypocrite if I did that. There’s a fine line between sharing good ideas and things that sound like they’d be worthwhile and preaching them as gospel and it’s hard to see when initially observed.</p>

<p>Take it from me. There are times when I want to tell the world how awesome it is to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half/">get up early</a> in the morning, sit down, and kick some creative ass, all before breakfast, except I can’t manage to do that, myself, right now. So I don’t. I use to. I used to tout how awesome it was, regularly.</p>

<p>Back then, though, I did it. Every single day. I woke up between 3:30 and 4:00 A.M., hopped in the shower, made coffee, and sat down with enough time for almost an hour of un-interrupted creativity and morning reflection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>take care of your own yard before you start criticizing your neighbor’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I refuse to tout what I don’t follow or believe, myself. I think it’s important to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/on-accepting/">nut up or shut up</a>. I know <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/">struggling</a> with <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/">inspiration</a> is real. I’ve discovered <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/">creativity</a> comes to those who <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/">hunt it down</a> like a rabid wolf hunts a juicy deer. I know what it’s like to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/">have your mind</a> in the <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/">wrong place</a>.</p>

<p>Most of all, I know <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/incapacity/">making excuses</a> is for the weak. The <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/professional-life-liver/">professional</a> doesn’t <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/magic/">make an excuse</a>. Take it from me.</p>

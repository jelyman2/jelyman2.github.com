    <p>We’re always striving for more. We always want to have the competitive edge, to have just a bit more money, to look just a bit better. Sometimes, when we get to that level we want for ourselves, we’re not exactly thrilled with what we find.</p>

    <p>Social media is all around us at this point. It’s hard to avoid a conversation or an interaction with someone without it involving some sort of social media communication. One could argue that it’s the more current version of email, text messaging, and letter writing of days, decades, and centuries past, sure. I’m not entirely sure where I stand on it. I enjoy checking things out on Facebook, I <a href="http://instagram.com/jlymanphoto">post my photography</a> to Instagram, I <a href="http://twitter.com/theejl">tweet</a>… but I enjoy a good face-to-face conversation, too… </p>

        Desk 1.2

    <p>I am super stoke to see Desk reach version 1.2. I’m also stoked to see a bunch of stuff fixed or improved that I was itching for!</p>

<p>I’ve been a user of desk for the last month and change, and I’m still really enjoying the app. It’s simple and it practically forces me to think about writing first. A couple of the biggest changes that I was looking forward to were the ability to adjust view amount of screen real estate being used for text (and the fact that it’s adjustable), and the spacing between paragraphs has been fixed. The issue surrounding odd spacing showing up in the editor when text was stylized seems to be fixed, too, which is a nice plus!</p>

<p>If you’re not a Desk user, go download it now. It’s $30 on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk-write-more/id915839505?mt=12">Mac App Store</a> and well worth the price!</p>

    <p>I picked up The Martian by way of a recommendation a friend gave me. I’ve seen it on the shelf for a minute now and I’m pretty excited to start listening to it. Most books I don’t read (a <a href="http://jlyman.net/turning-pro">recent purchase</a> being an exception) but instead listen to via Audible. If you’re not an Audible user, give them a shot. Like everything else I recommend, I am an Audible user and greatly enjoy their service. If you want a listen along with me, <a href="http://go.jlyman.net/audibleft30">click here</a> to sign up for a free trial and get a <strong>two</strong> free books to keep, even if you hate the service. I’ll be updating occasionally, like a digital book club of sorts, as I progress through the book. I’m excited!</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong> Turns out my info was a bit off. Instead of a free audiobook, you get  <strong>two</strong> free audiobooks. Oops!</p>

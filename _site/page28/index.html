        Recovering from Failure
      </a>

    <p>Yesterday, I failed. I failed pretty hard. It hurt a lot.</p>

<p>As you may well know, the search for a new job in San Francisco is on. A recent application I placed with a company I very well respect and admire got a response. They sent me a performance assessment to run through. I thought this would be an amazing time to shine.</p>

<p>Turns out, there was no shining to be had. I bombed it spectacularly. By the end of the hour, I likely received the worst possible score the test is capable of, short of not taking it at all. What’s worse, I went into it thinking I would be able to master it since it’s in my field. It’s stuff I know how to do.</p>

<p>Or so I thought.</p>

<p>My experience and views towards my experience came into question quite thoroughly. I’m not completely over it, yet, as the impact was greater than most rejections because of the company in question. I had my heart set on working for an awesome company on an awesome product that I really enjoyed, myself. Now that likely won’t happen.</p>

<p>My wife tells me it will be alright, and while it’s hard to agree with that right now, she’s right. There’s another test waiting for me that I haven’t started yet. I’m not sure if I’ll actually take it. I don’t know if I want to go through what I went through yesterday, one more time. Sure there’s a chance I can ace it, but that still doesn’t really show I’m qualified.</p>

<p>I’m going to mull this over, today, and see how I feel. If I decide to take it, I’ll do it tonight. Whether I pass or fail, it’ll make a good story to write about, tomorrow.</p>

<p>Now’s the time to recover from this failure. It still stings, but I can still build back up that foundation I’m standing on and keep the hunt going. It’s not something I’ll forget easily, but it’s a fact of life. Part of turning pro is accepting failures and moving on from them as they happen. Sometimes shit really does happen and there’s nothing you can do about it. In my case, more education and experience could possibly have fixed my situation, but that’s not a for sure notion.</p>

        The Weekend Off

    <time datetime="2015-03-02T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>I took the weekend off from blogging. It’s the first time in a while that I haven’t posted something, even just a link. I wanted to take time and focus on myself and personal enrichment. Because I’m looking for a new job since we’re moving, it was fitting that I spend most of my time in that category, including education. I spent all weekend working on my CCNA and sprucing up my Linux deployment skills. It’s nothing too exciting, but I did learn that NodeJS is a little memory leaker, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>I started a <a href="http://dev.jlyman.net">dev blog</a> running Ghost, just for kicks, and let it sit. It gets zero traffic, but NodeJS keeps using more memory. I feel it’s one of those things that’ll eventually use as much as it can and deal with the repercussions later. I am not thrilled. I’ll keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Needless to say I’m back on the horse for the week ahead. Next weekend will likely yield the same set of tasks, but I might sneak in a post or two.</p>

    <p>Samsung <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/galaxy-s6-and-s6-edge-hands-on-samsung-finally-builds-a-premium-smartphone/">announced the Galaxy S6</a> over the weekend. It looks pretty slick, and oddly like an iPhone. The only problem: it runs Android.</p>

        Shot on iPhone 6

    <p>Apple has a new page on their site titled “ <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/world-gallery/">Shot on iPhone 6</a>.” This collection of photographs feature some of the best images taken with an iPhone 6. Of course, low light is still uncharted territory for the iPhone and you probably won’t see any of them in this mega gallery. I only got through roughly two dozen photos before I realized how long the list actually is. </p>

<p>For your <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/world-gallery/">viewing pleasure</a>.</p>

    <p>We all make mistakes, right? That’s not just me?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mistakes are the portals of discovery. ~ James JoyceTo err is to be human, and even though we’re always striving for greatness, sometimes we falter. It’s what happens when you’ve hit bottom that counts.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, don’t give up. That’s a mistake all in itself.</p>

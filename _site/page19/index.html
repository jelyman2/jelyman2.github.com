        Thinking About Old Posts

    <p>Looking back on old posts isn’t really something that I do on a regular basis. Once I’m all set and posting my words, that’s pretty much it. I have a good reason, though. If I started going back and reviewing my past posts, I feel like I might end up second guessing my work before I post it in the first place.</p>

<p>There’s one time I go back and review that doesn’t have to do with copy editing. When I feel like formatting suffered or something just didn’t turn out right, then I’ll for sure review it. If I’m talking about a particular topic and I find a link to share after the fact, I might link it in the post later.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the first time around is usually the most genuine with writing, the words we say, or any mixture of the two. I try to keep it that way as much as possible.</p>

    <p>From <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-office-online-update-improves-onedrive-saving-pdf-printing/">ZDNet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The update’s file management improvements include the ability to save a copy of a file to OneDrive and select a new location in different folders to store the document. … Microsoft has added a Save As option, where the user can choose from Save As, Rename, Download a Copy, or Download as a PDF.There’s now a one click option to save files to OneDrive via a new Add to OneDrive button on the toolbar for Excel,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft has also tidied up the start page to make it faster to begin editing a document.</p>

<p>Bing also gets promoted via the Tell Me function in Help.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>I like Office, I really do. it’s hard to find a really good alternative these days. Apple’s offerings were neutered a couple years ago, and the open source alternatives just seem janky.</p>

<p>However, one could print to PDF with Chrome for like years, now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday a new website and database launched called NoFlyZone.org, which invites people to enter their home address to prevent amateur drone pilots from zooming over their property, GoPro running. The database is maintained by a team of 10 people based in El Segundo, California, and led by Ben Marcus, a private pilot and drone operator.I have a pretty good idea what organizations won’t be using this database.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest “duh” technologies that we got in the last year or two was the phone kill switch. Lose your phone? Nuke it from orbit. Phone stolen? Nuke it from orbit. Jealous ex texting you at 3am? If you know their Apple ID password, nuke it from orbit.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0LF09520150211?irpc=932">Reuters</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thefts involving smartphones have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing “kill switches” that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen, authorities said on Tuesday.That’s great. Now if only there was some way to educate the remaining group of individuals responsible for stealing phones anyway.</p>

    <p>I read some powerful words, yesterday, and I knew right away they were worth discussing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you think, so shall you become. <br />
– UnknownIt’s powerful stuff but the words speak a simple message. We’re surrounded my many different influences that can shape our thoughts and actions, but the biggest influence is ourselves. We’re the ones that make the final decision on whether to act a certain way, and those decisions are based on the thoughts we have. Having a positive mind leads to leading a positive life, but one cannot have the latter without the former. It cannot be expected that by being negative and pessimistic on the inside will still allow for an upbeat life on the outside. Take care of yourself by taking care of where your head is at. It’s the first and biggest step to improving anything and everything else around you.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen such a great <a href="http://vimeo.com/118471437">story about a bridge</a>? Neither have I. At roughly ten minutes in length, Lightning Boy Studio comes at us with a great animated tale with no speaking on two men who were determined to fix or rebuild a bridge that had fallen away into a vast canyon. A couple years ago, this video was a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1662185920/le-gouffre-animated-short-film">Kickstarter campaign</a> that passed its goal by 5x. Let’s not forget there are a few feels, too.</p>

    <p>I’m skeptical about <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/photos-preview/">Photos for Mac</a>. The last time Apple made a photo editing product, no one used it (Aperture). I’m sure it’ll look best and work best on the highest end Macs with the best screens (Retina iMac).</p>

<p>Either way. I’ll probably give it a shot.</p>

  <p>Introducing Photos for OS X. Featuring an easy-to-use and streamlined design, Photos has been engineered from the ground up to help you keep your growing library organized and accessible. Powerful and intuitive editing tools help you perfect your images as well as create beautiful gifts for sharing.

    <time datetime="2015-02-10T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">10 Feb 2015</time>

    <p>My desire to write continues to grow. When I first start at the beginning of the year, I was writing once a day, and I felt like that wouldn’t be sustainable so I <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart" title="Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year">told myself</a> I would write a few times a week. Turns out, I enjoy it a lot more than I thought I did. Writing has given me an opportunity to not just put my thoughts on digital paper and share with the world, but be able to look back at things that happened over the last day or so and reflect on them if I feel said topics are important. I have a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/311/desk-overview" title="Just Sit Down and Write with Desk">great app</a> to write with, and fortunately my wife support me. It’s hard to say if I’d ever make it a career but as it stands right now, I could write about stuff for hours.</p>

<p>Who knows what 2015 will hold. The summer will bring a whole host of <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/246/scared-to-act" title="Scared to Act">new changes and new experiences</a> for my family and I’m excited and terrified, but mostly excited.</p>

    <p>From out of the Ashes of The Unofficial Apple Weblog comes Apple World.Today and <a href="http://appleworld.today">it looks to be great</a>.</p>

<p>I’m glad to see some of the former editors firing up another site and continuing the never ending task of brining us great Apple news. Steve Sande, Dave Caolo, and Kelly Hodgkins are  steering the new ship and hope to bring us some great content.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our goal with Apple World Today is to pick up where TUAW left off as a source of news and reviews. But we want to take the site to you, the readers, by offering discussion forums (are we crazy to do this?), podcasts, and more video content. Wherever possible, we want to get our audience engaged by joining with us in online and live on-the-air discussions.Sweet.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>AWT is a relative baby in the world of blogging about that company from Cupertino, and as such you can expect us to poop ourselves on a regular basis as we get used to our new home.I hope the rough analogies to new, non-house-trained pets don’t continue, though. <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

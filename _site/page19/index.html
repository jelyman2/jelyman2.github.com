    <p>I picked up a new book yesterday morning by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turning-Pro-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B0087TUM54">Steven Pressfield called Turning Pro</a>. Actually, I downloaded it to my iPad with the Amazon Kindle app (does anyone actually “pick up” books anymore?). I’m quite intrigued so far with what the author has to say. He sounds like he’s seen some stuff and went through a lot of trials in life before finding the path that leads to success and meaningful contribution to life. There’s no magic key, no one-step process to instant awesomeness. It takes work. As I keep reading, I’ll share some thoughts that I have. So far, I’m impressed with seeing from where Pressfield has come and how much effort he put into turning himself around and doing more than the menial. He was even a truck driver at one point. And he lived in a cabin in the woods. That’s pretty interesting.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>“Creativity is an act of defiance.” – Twyla Tharp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creativity is an act of expression using unique methods to convey your thoughts and ideas. We have many forms of creative expression available to us in these times, however it didn’t used to be that way. Creative expression was limited and people who stepped outside the box create by the government or the church were doomed to punishment or worse. Don’t ever take for granted the amount of opportunity you have to share your voice, however small you think it may be. Should the day ever come where we look back on ourselves and witness the changes that happened right under our noses and we kept our thoughts and our voices to ourselves, we will be filled with deep regret and sadness.</p>

    <p>I want to talk for a minute about a particular service I really enjoy and have been using since 2012. I also want to be very clear that I’m not being paid to write this. I only endorse products and services I actually use. As of this writing I do not gain a percentage of any sales made in relation to this article. </p>

<p>Now that we have that out of the way, let’s talk about backing up your computer.</p>

<p>It’s important. Super important, in fact. Hard drives die all the time, and SSDs die, too; don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I back up my computer all the time to two locations: local and offsite. The former is in the form of a Time Machine I set up using an external HDD (3TB, USB 2.0). The latter is an offsite backup solution that send folders I choose to the cloud. </p>

<p>This cloud backup service is called CrashPlan. You might have heard of it, and if you have, that’s great. If you’re already a user, that’s even better. There are many cloud backup plans out there but this one I find is the best and the overall experience is outstanding, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Starting out, you get a free month to give it a shot. Signing up at CrashPlan.com requires zero payment, and if your free trial ends, you’re not on the hook for more months. The way the service keeps your membership up to date is through a serial number. You can purchase one or more licenses on the site, and plug them into computers where CrashPlan is installed. You don’t actually have to punch in your account information all the time in the CrashPlan app.</p>

<p>Backups occur in the background, out of sight. If you’re busy using your computer, it’ll backup at a slower and quieter pace. When you’re machine is idle, it’ll speed up, and spend more time working on your files.</p>

<p>One thing that sets CrashPlan apart is the fact that it can be used to backup your files to a local disk as well as another system on or offsite for free. The only thing you pay for is cloud. All files are encrypted before transmission and remain so when they land in the cloud. Only you can see the contents of a file and only your account and decrypt them. </p>

<p>Use a smartphone and access your files anywhere. Use another computer and download them from their Web site. Backup up to ten computers in your household for as low as $8.96 a month or get started with just a single computer for as low as $3.96 a month. Obviously the more machines your have and the farther ahead you pre-pay, the better your deal will be.</p>

<p>Give CrashPlan a shot. I love them. They’ve been running on my system for almost three years now and I haven’t had a single complaint. It’s a backup service I can set and forget and they’ve done a great job of staying out of the way while making sure the files I find most important are backed up on a regular basis.</p>

    <p>I caught an article this morning from <a href="http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a32668/invisible-girlfriend-experiment/">Esquire</a> talking about the writer’s experiences with <a href="http://invisiblegirlfriend.com">InvisibleGirlfriend.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter what I asked, Zoe always had a logical response. If she didn’t, she expertly skirted the question. Sometimes her texts were ominous, sometimes oddly detailed. She was always in a good mood. She didn’t mind if I ignored her for hours, though she always responded to me within minutes. She never texted first. If I didn’t initiate that day’s conversation, we simply didn’t talk.LOL… <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I kept reading the article and came to an odd conclusion: there really is something out there for everyone. At the same time, I became a little sad. The somethings out there for “everyone” include people behind a wall getting paid per text to have small talk with someone. Ten bucks says Zoe, the woman the author highlights in the article, looks nothing like her picture.</p>

    <p>It’s been roughly 40 days since I started writing on a continual basis. Some days have been more productive than others. There are days when all I manage to come up with are posts about other things going on in the world. I have enjoyed being able to just sit down and discuss what’s on my mind. When I sit down and talk about something that’s on my mind I end up writing a boat load of words. These <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill">two</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades">posts</a> are good examples. The first covered <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/47/fire-drill">project management buzzwords</a> and the second covers a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/572/50-shades">god-awful movie</a>.</p>

<p>There is one thing I do more now than I ever did before. I think about what I want to talk about tomorrow. When something appears in my head I determine if it is good fodder for my blog. I don’t have a real direction for my blog just yet. This will change with time. For now I focus on writing and discussing topics I find important. I know someone out there will find them to be interesting. Perhaps they’ll share what they read with their friends. I won’t ever know if they don’t like them because I don’t use post comments. I decided comments were useless. They don’t contribute to my blogging experience in the least bit. </p>

<p>One more cool thing has happened. I didn’t use a comma in this whole post.</p>

    <p>I tried a lot of different titles for this post, starting the moment I left the theater last night. This one seems to fit the best.</p>

<p>Heads up: if you haven’t read the books, my recounting the movie might spoil something for you. There’s nothing in the movie that wasn’t in the book so don’t freak out. Keep your pants on. No one needs to see that. Also, I’ll probably end up ranting by the end of this. </p>

<p>My wife is a fan of the books, and I don’t blame her. She likes to read that sort of thing, just like millions of other women. I don’t fault her for that, and I never will. It became an adult fiction sensation of sorts and eventually a movie. </p>

<p>I’ve never read the books, and if I had a plan to read them before, I certainly don’t now. I saw the movie last night on Valentine’s Day because my wife thought it would be romantic and fun. Me being the cynic I am, scoffed at the idea but since I like to support my wife in her decisions and ideas, I opted to go without making too much of a fuss—I did make a lot of jokes about ‘butt stuff’ on our way to the theater, though, because I can be rather immature at times and jokes about ‘butt stuff’ is funny in this context.</p>

<p>The line to get into the theater was long, but not Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings long. It was composed of two groups of people: women with their women friends who are excited to see Jamie Dornan naked doing sexy things, and couples where the woman likely brought the man so she could see Jamie Dornan naked doing sexy things in hopes he’ll think said sexy things are worth attempting back at home.</p>

<p>This is my first exposure to the actual story of Christian Grey beyond anecdotes my wife shared with me in the last couple of years while she read the books. I frankly didn’t remember anything about him other than that he liked butt stuff and was an asshole. To have a movie surrounding that? Whew, I’m excited…</p>

<p>Dakota Johnson’s character, Anastasia Steele turned out exactly how I thought she would. Nothing fits the whole storyline of an inexperienced woman meeting a man who knows all sorts of kinky moves like a woman who’s never been with a man, period. Might as well go all the way, I guess. Johnson and Dornan are good looking people and fit the roles well up to that point. Johnson’s character is too awkward to not be noticed in the way that fingernails can’t be ignored on a chalkboard, and Dornan sucks at being an American. Plus, anyone with the last name of Steele, according to every other romance novel in existence should be better prepared for just about anything. Did anyone notice the dynamic between the names Grey and Steele? Let that sink in for a minute. Yes. The author lacks that much creativity. Moving on.</p>

<p>The film opens up exactly like you would expect. A 20-something girl just trying to get by, doing that whole homebody thing with not much time for men as she just tries to get by in school and at her ‘meh’ job at a place in which she has no interest. The all of a sudden a magnificent piece of chiseled man enters her life because why the hell not. Add a dash of awkward, another cup of awkward, and a pinch of bad writing, and you have the opening scenes of the movie.</p>

<p>As we move throughout the movie, I notice particulars about Seattle that the filmmakers would hope no one would notice. First, North Seattle is not 90 miles away from Seattle and it’s definitely not called Portland. Yes. They think that little of you. The scene involving Ana entering the freeway on her journey to Seattle to interview Grey was shot ten miles north of Seattle. Conveniently it was the exact same place where I saw this movie—the theater was in the background. Somehow they figured out how to bend space-time since 90 miles opened up between what us Seattle people call Northgate and downtown Seattle. While I’m enjoying pointing out how wrong that scene was, let me point out: there is a hell of a lot more than 90 miles between Portland and Seattle. Let’s try 170, depending on where you’re coming and going. Way to go, guys. You didn’t even try. A lot of the other scenes in the movie are in real locations, and points to whomever did the areal footage while we had our Seahawks flag up on the Space Needle. </p>

<p>As a man, this movie frustrated me quite a bit, not because there was a better looking man on the screen doing weird shit with a girl who’s never had sex in her life, but because he’s a pompous asshole. I wanted to title this post “50 Shades of Pompus Asshole” but that was too narrow. The story basically boiled down to a guy with mommy issues who was basically beaten by an adult woman friend as a minor. Never mind the fact that Johnson’s character reacts none to the fact that he was underage and where BSDM starts, sex finishes, especially in this movie. If he was re-living his dominant-submissive experiences on the dominant side this time, he was definitely raped statutorily for many years. That’s anecdotal though, right? No one really cares about that. Right?</p>

<p>Whatever. Pushing that aside, too, we’re still left with a sliver of a relationship dynamic. During “contract negotiations” he offers her one date night a week. Well, Mr. Pompus Asshole, thanks so much for allowing her to have a shred of kindness from you beyond superficial shit you buy her every week. It’s so nice that you’re willing to come down off your massive ivory entitlement tower and be a real human. </p>

<p>Throughout this whole movie, I honestly wanted to tell him to go fuck himself. The acting was bad, but that’s not a big deal. Acting is bad is a lot of romantic drama comedies. I hated his character and not in a good way. When the movie entered the final scene, I hated his character, but I hated E. L. James and the director this bucket of crap we call a movie even more. To think that it would be some woman’s fantasy to be downright assaulted to tears and that it’s a good thing is selfish, disgusting, and downright fucked up. After the movie ended, I realized one thing. The books were written by a woman who has issues. She probably enjoys all of this shit and what better way to live it out but in a book and eventually a movie? Who wouldn’t like to see their fantasies played out like that? People have been saying that there’s nothing wrong with a woman putting her fantasies on paper, and normally I would agree with that statement. This time, however, I can’t believe that a woman would only want a man to beat her, shove shit up her butt and vagina, and be OK with zero emotional contact. It all reeks of unresolved issues from both parties. </p>

<p>I couldn’t help but wonder if I’m just over-reacting and not taking the movie-book smack fest at face value, so I turned to two sites that would either confirm my suspicions that I’m not the only one who feels this way or demonstrate that I’m turning into an old man and should just say home and let the kids do their kinky shit. Fandango.com was a waste of time. The reviews there were basically fangirls freaking out that there were people out there who think it’s all a pile of shit and padding the ratings to defend whatever fucked up love story they think the first 50 Shades of Grey resembled. IMDB.com told a much different story. Where Fandango had 15,000-something “reviews” with 4/5 on average, IMDB had 393,000-something people who marked it at an average 3.2/10. Granted one does not have to write a review to rate a movie and it’s pretty easy to pad the ratings on IMDB, but the reviews (only 400 or so) told a more accurate story. It was hard to find someone who saw the movie and actually liked it. There weren’t any screaming fangirls, here. No one shouting “I want Grey’s babies” or anything of the sort. Just people saying abuse is not romance and this movie shouldn’t be treated as anything remotely romantic. At least I’m not alone in thinking that.</p>

<p>After the movie ended, I asked my wife if it gets better. She tells me things get much better in the 2nd and 3rd books, and they end up getting married. That’s great. We could have boiled down those three books into one movie, though. No need for three. Man has problems, meets girl, girl tries to fix him, girl fixes him, they get married. The end. I pretty much described every romantic dramedy. </p>

<p>It’s also easy for me to sit here and basically hate on this movie, the books, and E. L. James. And if you were to tell me that to my face, you’d be right. It’s super easy, thank to the Internet. But as someone who came into the whole scene without any prior information or knowledge about what happens in the story, it’s also super easy for me to make an unbiased judgement about the story, the premise, the characters, and make hypotheses about what’s going through E. L. James’ head. My opinion is just that, mine, and I’m sure there’s a whole host of people out there—mostly women, I’m sure—who’d think I’m just another dick who just doesn’t understand that all Steele wants is to make him love because she loves him. Sorry to break your world of fantasy, but I figured that one out on my own, already. See the last couple of paragraphs.</p>

<p>All in all, this movie could be worse. The acting was meh, the art direction was pretty good, and it was in Seattle. The characters are good looking, sure, but I’m sure the extent of male satisfaction was just to see Dakota Johnson take it from behind. I can’t even try to describe what women are seeing in this whole thing. I get the teasing and foreplay, but the pain and beating just seems odd and unresolved-issue laden. I may never know, and that’s fine. For the sake of supporting my wife, I may go see the 2nd and 3rd movies, if they ever actually hit theaters (or go straight to disc, like all paltry sequels) and hope to God that Grey stops being such a dick. I’ve never wanted to reach through the screen and blow someone’s brains out all over their marble floors like I did with him… I know what happens, but as it stands right now, I hate him (and people like him). </p>

    <p>It’s not going to change anything. I follow McDonalds on Facebook. A lot of people do. I do it because I like McDonalds. I eat it more than I should but that’s a different story altogether. I find it fascinating that people troll McDonald’s Facebook page almost without reprieve.</p>

<p>Take a look at the below series of “questions” asked by commenters of a post McDonalds made about their eggs:</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-02-14-10.07.12.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Consume those mind-numbing questions and let’s discuss.</p>

<p><strong>#1. Pink Slime</strong></p>

<p>This comes up every time. There’s a turd bucket out there who insists they’re right no matter what and asks the company <em>yet again</em> if they use Pink Slime in their meat. Let’s not forget this whole thing was discussed recently in great detail, already. </p>

<p><strong>#2. Sauce on Bagel</strong></p>

<p>If you know how to look up ingredients for anything, you could probably figure this one out on your own which is a great transition into the third comment. I’ll admit not everyone thinks about that, but it’s 2015 and clearly they have Internet access. I’m not one to give the benefit of the doubt if it’s not warranted.</p>

<p><strong>#3. French Fry Ingredients</strong></p>

<p>Someone’s never made french fries in stupid large volumes before. Someone’s never made french fries on their own before, period, I’m guessing. It requires a few extra ingredients to execute such tasks on the scale McDonalds needs. This was something they discussed in great detail already, too. Someone wasn’t present for that, it seems.</p>

<p><strong>#4. Egg McMuffin</strong></p>

<p>Someone goes to a crappy restaurant. Probably a good idea to change? Product support on a company’s Facebook page is the best kind there is, though.</p>

<p><strong>#5. Egg Beaters</strong></p>

<p>Someone didn’t read. Moving on.</p>

<p><strong>#6. More Egg Beaters</strong></p>

<p>One likely disgruntled employee is obviously right. Reading must really not be a thing, anymore.</p>

<p>It pretty clearly sounds like I’m a McDonalds supporter. And to an extent, I might be, as much as I enjoy eating their food. I’m also a supporter of not being stupid. Clearly trolling is the best tactic to making sure a company fails. I won’t ever say McDonalds is even remotely good for you, but things really have to be done a certain way in order to be made and run on the scale that McDonalds operates. </p>

<p>People will disagree with me, and that’s fine. I don’t care. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.</p>

    <p>I brought my computer with me on the bus this morning to see if I could write while riding and came to one horrible conclusion. It’s impossible. One thing bus manufacturers haven’t thought about it making enough space for people to do work comfortably. What’s up with that? Then there’s those crazy side-facing seats. I unfortunately was limited to one of those for a place to sit, if I didn’t want to share with someone and have them look over my shoulder. Aside: don’t think the person next to you isn’t glancing down at your screen. I’m talking to you, co-workers who work for one of the biggest software companies in the world.</p>

<p>The above paragraph was written solely while riding public transportation. As it turns out, it’s incredibly hard to do. The seats are too close together. Maybe I have too big of a computer. Perhaps wanting to have a decently-sized keyboard and a good screen to look at is too much to ask. I should be using an iPad these days, right? Or better yet, just blogging on my phone because that’s what the kids do.</p>

<p>Whatever. I want to use my computer. There’s not much else to this post besides me complaining that I can’t blog on the bus the way I want to. I should probably just stick to blogging at my desk. I seem to enjoy it much more, there. Plus, there’s no one looking over my shoulder as I type. (fact: big pet peeve)</p>

    <p>Looking back on old posts isn’t really something that I do on a regular basis. Once I’m all set and posting my words, that’s pretty much it. I have a good reason, though. If I started going back and reviewing my past posts, I feel like I might end up second guessing my work before I post it in the first place.</p>

<p>There’s one time I go back and review that doesn’t have to do with copy editing. When I feel like formatting suffered or something just didn’t turn out right, then I’ll for sure review it. If I’m talking about a particular topic and I find a link to share after the fact, I might link it in the post later.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the first time around is usually the most genuine with writing, the words we say, or any mixture of the two. I try to keep it that way as much as possible.</p>

    <p>From <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-office-online-update-improves-onedrive-saving-pdf-printing/">ZDNet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The update’s file management improvements include the ability to save a copy of a file to OneDrive and select a new location in different folders to store the document. … Microsoft has added a Save As option, where the user can choose from Save As, Rename, Download a Copy, or Download as a PDF.There’s now a one click option to save files to OneDrive via a new Add to OneDrive button on the toolbar for Excel,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft has also tidied up the start page to make it faster to begin editing a document.</p>

<p>Bing also gets promoted via the Tell Me function in Help.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>I like Office, I really do. it’s hard to find a really good alternative these days. Apple’s offerings were neutered a couple years ago, and the open source alternatives just seem janky.</p>

<p>However, one could print to PDF with Chrome for like years, now.</p>

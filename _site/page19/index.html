        Ten Days a Californian
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-04-16T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">16 Apr 2015</time>

    <p>If my calendar is correct, ten days of living in California is today. As someone who’s lived in one state their whole life, nay, one metro area in one state, it’s been a huge change. The world around me is fresh and exciting, but equally craptacular.</p>

<p>The good news is, I’m not leaving. Maybe that’s also the bad news, who knows. We’re here for the long haul and I’ve discussed and mentally prepared for it <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/scared-to-act">quite</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/be-ready">far</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/couch-chapter">in</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/wasted">advance</a>. I even highlighted my trip by day in summary (day <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-1">1</a>, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-2">2</a>, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-3">3</a>, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-4">4</a>) and <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/dust-settling">reflected</a> briefly after all the dust settled.</p>

<p>I’ll just come right out and say it: this place is dry. Not dry like “my clothes are dry, this dryer rocks!” More like: “my clothes turn to dust! This dryer rocks!” The humidity was 14% today. That might not seem like much but to compare, think desert. No, not dessert. One “s,” like the sounds snakes make… in the desert.</p>

<p>See exhibit A.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/361745-5.jpeg?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>That about sums it up.</p>

<p>It’s not all bad, though. Moving from a state that gets eight feet of rain a year to a state that gets sloppy seconds from Mother Nature has perks. It’s sunny, a lot! This time of year, we were lucky to see the sun. It rained. Of course now that I’ve moved away, Washington’s getting a sexy session with the sun and there’s a lot of sun to go around.</p>

<p>I’m also tan. It took exactly one day to become tan. Us northern people tan easy. Too bad it doesn’t make traffic any less of a suck-fest and California drivers any more skilled at using their turn signals.</p>

<p>I could rant for a solid hour on California drivers, but I don’t think that’s necessary. This guy has a pretty good summary on video, so consume this 18 minutes of sad-but-true. Half of this I see on a regular basis.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMR_BVpMvl8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I don’t feel I’ve given California enough credit. The ocean is damn awesome and I love being so close to it. Without traffic, it’s 45 minutes. That’s spectacular. In Washington, it was a four hour romp (each way) that included an hour (each way) and $50 (round trip) on a ferry. Given the scale of the Bay Area, everything’s so close, too. Public transit (train-based) is legit and quick to move around. The bus system blows harder than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina">Katrina</a>, though. Who needs to have a 45 minute layover half-way through a 10 mile journey?</p>

<p>Maybe this guy:</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

        California Move Day 4 &#8211; It&#8217;ll Fit, Watch!

    <time datetime="2015-04-14T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">14 Apr 2015</time>

    <p>This was the day we were all waiting for. The day we drive into town, unload the truck, and start our lives in California. This was also the day I forgot how much I don’t like moving up and down stairs.</p>

<p>When I pulled in, I barely fit. The power steering was whining because I insisted on holding the wheel all the way to the right. The truck fit, and the trailer followed behind, by only by a hair. Mere inches were between my front bumper and the gate edge, and same with my trailer wheels. Someone didn’t think the entrance through enough.</p>

<p>Either way, I found a place to park the truck and get rid of the trailer so we could unload. It was warm, but not super hot… 60-something, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>It only took a few hours to unload the truck when we counted breaks. Having help was nice, especially when it came to conquering the three flights of stairs. Before dinner, we were done and the truck was back where it belonged.</p>

<p>So glad it’s over.</p>

        California Move Day 3 &#8211; Coming &#8216;Round the Mountain

    <time datetime="2015-04-12T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">12 Apr 2015</time>

    <p>The Siskiyous mountains are rough for a moving truck. At times we hummed along at 55 to 60 mph and when we hit big climbs, we sputtered at 35 to 40. It’s rough going for a gas-powered truck-trailer. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, please let me fill you in.</p>

<p>Gas-powered trucks have zero oomph when pulling a load. None. Their torque is present at a much higher rev range than diesel and unfortunately, those higher revs also sit close to the engine’s limit. I wanted to give the truck 100% throttle to power up the hills, but if I did, I felt it would explode. See, to make our journey up a 7% grade even at 40 mph, the engine needed to run at 4000-4250 RPM. For scale, the gauge stops at 6000 and the truck shifts well before then. I was at my limit.</p>

<p>Even with such slow and gas-guzzling climbs, we managed to stay on target for fuel usage and didn’t lose too much time. The most embarrassing part: loaded semi trucks passing you. Damn you, Budget Truck.</p>

<p>After we got out of the mountains, we made a quick pit stop in Redding, CA to top off and sprinted to Sacramento, where we met friends for our last night on the road.</p>

        California Move Day 2 &#8211; To Medford
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-04-12T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">12 Apr 2015</time>

    <p>Now the real fun begins. There’s nothing more that I’ve wanted from life than to drive a 40’ truck-trailer combination over 900 miles. Today’s journey took us to Medford, OR, where we make our first of two on-the-road stops.</p>

<p>We chose to stay in the Ramada, and it’d been so long since I stayed in a place like that I forgot what it was like. Apparently, they opted to not redecorate since I last stayed in one in the 90s. The hotel was crap. I’m not sure it was worth the $64 a night price tag, but at least the WiFi was good. It was great actually. Probably because nobody was actually staying there besides truckers. The bed was hard and the breakfast was meh, but it did its job as a place to sleep for the night. Medford is a surprisingly beautiful area. The south Oregon mountains are awesome and quite a site to see, compared to the rest of the state.</p>

<p>Not much happened on the journey south. We sat in the truck for nine hours including stops, filled up once with what seemed like an entire tanker of gas, and somehow managed 12mpg, with car trailer. I was quite impressed, but at the same time, not. Budget really needs to stop using gas engines in their tow-capable trucks. We could have skipped a stop if we were rolling in a diesel truck.</p>

<p>I experienced a Popeye’s for the second time in my life. The first time involved me wishing I hadn’t experienced Popeye’s. This time, it was actually decent, but considering this was the fourth or fifth meal involving fast food, I was starting to feel pretty gross.</p>

<p>The bane of my existence has yet to come, however.</p>

        California Move Day 1 – Deposits My Ass
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-04-12T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">12 Apr 2015</time>

    <p>Today’s the day. We packed up all our stuff over the last couple of weeks and picked up our moving truck this morning. We loaded it all in a relatively short amount of time (we do only have an apartment, after all). So far, the trip’s been alright, as we haven’t left town, yet, and won’t until tomorrow morning. Funny story, though…</p>

<p>We were up at 6:30 getting ready to start the long day. I’m dreading the level of effort that’s about to be bestowed upon me by the laws of gravity and physics. By 7:30 we had breakfast. Thanks Jack in the Box!</p>

<p>By 8:00am, we were at the rental truck facility. By virtue of being the lowest price for our one-way trip, we graced Budget Truck with our presence. The place looked kinda sketchy and rightly so: it was nothing more than a double-wide. For a place that also offered rental cars via Avis, it was hard to tell what cars were actually available to rent.</p>

<p>At 8:30 we had the truck back home and ready to accept our crap. Most of our stuff was already boxed up so it came down to making trips two and from the truck with the dolly. This part only took a couple hours. Most of our furniture was boxed up (we ordered some new stuff, because why not!).</p>

<p>Come 10:30 and we’re back at Budget Truck ready for our car trailer. We’re taking a 22-foot truck (16 feet cargo space plus six feet for the chassis, give or take) and adding another 16.5-foot trailer on the back. I love the plan. This $45 trailer will net us $150 in gas savings.</p>

<p>Did I mention we have a cat? No? Well… we have a cat, and this is where it starts getting interesting.</p>

<p>It’s now 12:00 and we’re at our hotel, the Holiday In Express &amp; Suites. I’ve stayed there before and they were pretty nice for a 3-star hotel. I expected more nice-but-not-worthy-of-instagramming experiences. We checked in, and informed them of our cat, because I want to make sure the reservation at a pet-friendly hotel was still legitimate. Turns out it was, they are pet friendly. As it also turns out, they charge $50 per three nights as an added fee, like paying for a room for your pet. Oh… but according to Hanna, the wonderfully nice woman at the reception desk explained the moment she, herself discovered for the first time it seemed, they don’t take cats.</p>

<p>So there’s that.</p>

<p>I’m in a bit of a subdued panic because our whole schedule is pretty well locked down. We already turned in our apartment keys and for all intents and purposes, we’re transients. I’ll be honest, I paid $90 for my room through Hotwire. I thought it was a good deal. That’s about the price I paid the last time I stayed at HIES via Hotwire, roughly two to three years ago.</p>

<p>I give Hotwire a call, crossing my fingers they’ll refund my non-refundable purchase. Turns out they will, only if the room and or reservation isn’t as advertised. I had the right in two areas: 1) they were only <em>partially</em> pet friendly, something Hotwire didn’t advertise properly, and 2) the rate on Hotwire’s site should have been the only amount I had to pay, which it wasn’t. After roughly five minutes, it was all squared away and I had my money back.</p>

<p>But now what? I’m without a hotel room. In comes my trusty hotel sidekick to the rescue.</p>

<p>There’s a single hotel chain that’s always come through for my family and my wife’s family alike, the La Quinta. It’s roughly on the same level as HIES, and about the same price. I gave them a rang because I know their properties and know what kind of rooms they offer up. An ever so friendly gentleman named Kurtis (I checked, he spells it that way) helped us out. They had a room open tonight and they were pet friendly. They also don’t charge a fee, because that’s weird.</p>

<p>Since I’m a AAA member, they took 10% off and we were in business for $100. Sure it was $10 more, but I’d rather pay that difference than $50. It was within reason. Within 20 minutes we had our room and were moving in for the night.</p>

<p>It’s 1:00pm and nap time.</p>

<p>At around 3:30, my wife found it prudent to give our other hotel reservations a call and find out if they charge a separate pet fee. Turns out they both did. The Ramada in Medford, OR charges $20, and the Double Tree in Newark, CA charges $50. The $20 is okay, the $50 is not. I called Hotwire again, and complained once more. I fed them a story about false advertising and whatnot, and within a few minutes I had my money back, again. It would be great if Hotwire advertised extra fees like this before you buy your supposedly non-refundable stay.</p>

<p>I enjoyed our stay at the La Quinta. While it’s nothing special to look at they’re good at making breakfast and having comfy beds. They could step up their WiFi game a bit. The particular hotel I stayed at had misconfigured WiFi. All of their hotspots were on the same channel. If you’re not technically inclined enough to know what that means, let me use this analogy: imagine six people talking to you at the same time, at the same volume, saying the same thing. Which one are you going to pay attention to? With all of the hotel’s hotspots on the same frequency, doing the same thing, the airwaves become a garbled mess, and my laptop had a hard time staying connected. Noob move.</p>

<p>Overall, our first day was uneventful. We packed up and rested. The real fun begins on day two.</p>

    <p>I don’t play many videos games at the same time for one reason: I don’t have time. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy playing video games as much as the next mid-20s male. When I do have time to play a game, it has to be some thing I really want to play and play actively.</p>

<p>This is where I picked up Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. This is one of those games where I looked at it for some time and never bit the bullet but then one day my wife gifts it to me.</p>

<p>I started playing it yesterday, and am playing it as I write this and one thing jumped out right away: it’s hard.</p>

<p>And by hard I mean: I died a lot. The game itself isn’t very hard. It’s actually about on par with what I would expect for this style of gameplay. The problem lies from the idea that one can fire up the game and start slaughtering the world around them, and that’s definitely not true. The missions are in place for a reason: complete them. If you don’t, you’ll likely be missing out on some cool powers and upgrades that’ll keep you from dying so much later on.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MiddleEarthShadowofMordorFirst30MinutesGameplay-42.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once I realized that, I started mastering the art of slaughtering orcs and boy is it fun. As the story progresses, you start climbing the ranks of orcs and knocking them down, one by one. Don’t lose to them too often, though, as they’ll become more powerful and bring more friends with them, making them hard to beat.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ejrbrg5ciei5kyolvltw2.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you set your sights on a target, you want to do everything you can to take them down right way. Don’t half-ass your assassination attempt and be really good at countering attacks. They’ll knock you down and put you on your back in no time and before you know, you’ll be respawning. Learn each captain’s vulnerabilities, it’ll make life much easier for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shadow-mordor-review-12.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Beyond that, have fun. I really enjoy the game now that I know how to play it. Because I know how to play it, it’ll take longer to finish and grant me more reward for completing the smaller things, giving me that ever so needed satisfaction of progression and completion.</p>

    <p>I’m always looking for a new tool, app or service that can give me a leg up when it comes to investing and making it as painless as possible which is why I’m covering three tools that can help you invest and save with minimal effort.</p>

<h2 id="acorns">Acorns</h2>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_appstore_screenshots.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>They get their name from the same idea that squirrels have: when you find an acorn, you bury it in the ground and save it for winter. In this case, however, we’re not burying our money when we have extra change, we’re investing it.﻿﻿﻿ <a href="https://www.acorns.com">Acorns</a> is an iOS and Android app that allows you to take the spare change from each of your regular purchases you make on a debit or credit card and invest it.</p>

<p>For example, You spend $5.49 on coffee on Monday morning so you roll up that $5.49 to $6.00 and the remaining $0.51 is invested. You can do this automatically via the app or on your own, if you wish. It’s easier to think about than it seems because once you get into the habit of expecting all your purchases to be rounded to the next dollar, it’s cake. Personally, I do it manually, and that might work for you as well. They require minimum deposits of $5.00 so once your roll-ups reach that amount, a deposit will occur into your Acorns account (if you do it automatically). You can also have Acorns make regular deposits as well on a recurring basis if you so desire. You can even deposit your cashback you get on your credit cards! </p>

<p>Acorns offers five different investment plans, with each one having a unique blend of stocks (via ETFs) and bonds, depending on your style. If you’re looking for growth, a more aggressive plan will be more to your liking, while a conservative plan is better for keeping your capital locked in on a slow but steady path. You can use the app to determine how much your money might grow over time with their projection graphs and see how your money is doing on the home screen day by day. As an added bonus for Android users, you can see your account’s value in real time via their widget on your home screen! As an iPhone user, this is something that I’m actually very envious about. </p>

<p>Acorns is free on both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acorns-invest-spare-change/id883324671?mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acorns.android&amp;hl=en">Android</a> and takes roughly two business days to be fully signed up as they are an investment firm and have to follow the same rules as everyone else. They’re also open only to users within the United States (as they need a social security number). </p>

<h2 id="betterment">Betterment</h2>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_betterment_screenshots.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a long-term play and want a platform that can help you do some serious investing, Betterment is the game you want to play. ﻿Signing up is dead simple and their plans help you find a good place to start putting your money. On their homepage, all you need to do is punch in your age, if you’re retired, and how much you make, and they’ll cook up three awesome plans for you to choose from, starting with saving to create an emergency fund/nest egg. Having one of these is important as sometimes life happens and one should never rely on credit cards. </p>

<p>Once you’re signed up and verified, you can browse your account on their site or using their mobile app. Their plans are similar to Acorns in that your money is automatically allotted into specific categories of ETFs based on how the money is to be treated.</p>

<p>One thing to make sure I note is that unlike Acorns and RobinHood, Betterment does have a fee structure that you should be aware of, even though it’s super small and if you’re actively investing, you’ll barely notice. Their fee structure is based on your investment amount and they even provide an equivalent cost per month in real dollars and cents. For someone investing under $10,000 to start, they’ll be looking at an annual rate of 0.35% or roughly one dollar per month. This entry level plan requires a minim $100 auto-deposit every month. If you’re not comfortable with that yet or just don’t have the cash to make that kind of deposit, yet, don’t worry. Betterment assesses a flat fee of $3 per month for accounts with deposits of less than $100.</p>

<p>At $10,000, an investor can see the annual rate drop to 0.25% which will run roughly two dollars per month. (It’s important for me to note that the lower rate doesn’t start until $10,000 so an investor with $9,999 will be subject to the higher 0.35% minimum rate.) If you’re an investor who might be rolling in it and is working with $100,000, the rate drops again to 0.15% or roughly $13 per month.</p>

<p>With each step to higher better pricing structures, you’ll be offered additional services such as Tax Loss Harvesting ($50,000 minimum) and a personal advisor ($500,000 minimum). </p>

<p>For those who are unsure about the whole idea, rest easy with a 30-day no-cost intro option. At the end of 30 days, you’ll be placed into a plan based on your deposit status during the 30-day window.</p>

<p>The Betterment app is available for free on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/betterment-smarter-investing./id393156562?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterment&amp;hl=en">Google Play Store</a>.</p>

<h2 id="robinhood">RobinHood﻿</h2>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5up_robinhood_screenshots.png?resize=753%2C268" alt="" /></p>

<p>RobinHood is probably the slickest of the three app-services I describe here, today. One thing that’s plagued investors for a long time is that every time you make a trade, you have to pay a fee. That’s all fine and dandy if you have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars you’re moving around at any one time. A $250,000 trade minus $10 is nothing (0.004%, to be exact). For those who have smaller portfolios, say around the $1k to $10k range, those $10 fees add up ($10 from $1000 is 1%, a 250x increase). RobinHood’s goal is to stop making that a problem. They make their money off of you being their customer, so they don’t really need to charge you <em>any</em> per trade. Like Acorns, RobinHood is an app-only service so you can’t trade on your computer (yet). It’s technically not open to the public yet but they have been ramping up their beta enrollment quite a bit as of late. It’s definitely work looking into as it gives anyone with any amount of money access to buy stock without having to worry about losing a large fraction of their money every time they buy and sell. </p>

<p>You can sign up to get yourself on the waiting list at  <a href="https://www.robinhood.com">robinhood.com</a> and get the app on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-$0-commission-stock/id938003185?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Apple App Store</a>.</p>

    <p>One thing I’ve never liked about being up early in the morning is how dark it is outside throughout the winter. It’s hard getting up at 4AM and seeing nothing but the same darkness you saw when you went to bed the night before. Sure there’s a lot of excitement to be had at night, but for those of us with responsibilities, that’s just not an option. Instead I’m indoors, wondering what’s going on in the wee hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Late night and early morning can lead to a lot of great inspiration for when my list of things to talk about is running on fumes. With my regular stents of barfing my brain onto the internet now (practically every day), I have to now take to task the idea that I’m also responsible for regular creative thinking.</p>

<p>What about the night is so interesting?</p>

<p>Why are people attracted to the darkness?</p>

<p>Are day-time clubs even a thing?</p>

<p>I ponder all of these things, and more on a regular basis. Personally, I’ve never been one to go to a night club. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been to night clubs before, and back then it was mildly amusing having some girl rub her sweaty butt crack on me; don’t you think for one second that guys are the only ones that sweat.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it’s not even remotely interesting. Perhaps it has something to do with the idea that I grew up and care about more substantial things in life. If I wanted to pay $20 to drink, listen to overly loud music, and look stupid, I could do that at home, for free. Just saying.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hAAAB5DC6.gif"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hAAAB5DC6.gif?resize=500%2C323" alt="hAAAB5DC6" /></a></p>

<p>The night also harbors the second and third shift folks who keep the world running while we all sleep. I know this because I used to be one. Working 4PM to 1AM was awesome when I was 21, single, and caring little about getting up at noon every day. It was great. Leaving work at 1AM led to the most delicious Jack in the Box burgers anyone has ever tasted. They do something differently in the middle of the night because they tasted so much better. Maybe it was just my desire for greasiness in the middle of the night that made me feel that way.</p>

<p>All this pondering and reflecting on the night makes me wonder about a possible side project: regular stories about fictional people based on real people out being adventurous at night. Sounds like it could be good. One concern I have is how often I will be willing to stay up late at night and take notes. I sure as hell can’t magically come up with stories. The tales have to have some sort of truth behind them; that’s what makes them great! Otherwise, it’s just another story.</p>

<p>Perhaps more brainstorming is on the way…when the sun comes up.</p>

    <p>In 2007, The Onion—known for being the global source for all things truth—called RadioShack’s Demise. Today, RadioShack filed for bankruptcy protection. RadioShack is down, I see Fry’s coming soon. Have you been in one lately? They’re massive and never have anyone in them.</p>

    <p>This is my writing space. One would think that with my constant writing and seemingly never ending list of things to talk about, I’d have a super clean and awesome space to write that wasn’t the least bit distracting. Turns out, I’m not a super huge fan of minimalist spaces. I like having things to look at. When I’m pondering, it gives me something to study that ultimately leads me to my words. My last post about Dr. Better came solely because I was drinking one and the bottle was sitting right next to me. I could do to clean it up a bit, but I don’t feel that’s a super high priority. If was to organize my chaos a bit, those flowers wouldn’t move. That’s my wife’s wedding bouquet. She makes the final say on where that sits, and I kindly oblige. (Plus, she shares the desk, too, on occasion, so it’s only fair.)</p>

    <p>Let me tell you a story. A story about Dr. Better. See, Dr. Better wasn’t just good, he was better. Better than you and better than me. Dr. Better had a special talent. What was that talent, you ask? Why, being better, of course. </p>

<p>Now you might be wondering, exactly what was he better at? Let me tell you.</p>

<p>Dr. Better was better at being better… cola. </p>

<p>Cola?</p>

<p>Yes. Cola.</p>

<p>Dr. Better was better at Cola than anyone else who claimed to be better. One could argue Dr. Better was the best. Even if he was, he was still better.</p>

<p>Now that Dr. Better’s not a mystery, one could wonder if Dr. Better could be a better mystery, too…</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>The great advantage of being a writer is that you can spy on people. You’re there, listening to every word, but part of you is observing. Everything is useful to a writer, you see—every scrap, even the longest and most boring of luncheon parties. ~ Graham GreeneThere’s so much right with this quote. I won’t say I’m a spy, but I find other people’s conversations amusing. I’m also pondering something…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote got me wondering this morning what would happen if more people told their stories? There’s hardly a shortage of drama in the news today surrounding things like black rights, domestic violence, discrimination, education, and so on that if everyone told their story, I can’t help but believe something would actually be done about it.</p>

<p>Let’s think about this for a moment. There are X number of rape cases every year, right? (I leave the number as X because the quantity is irrelevant for this scenario) One of the biggest things surrounding rape and sexual assault is more often than it should be, the victim doesn’t come forward. What if the victim had a place to express their feelings without fear of being persecuted or being in danger? From a writing perspective and then from a sociological perspective, imagine how much more we’d hear about it? I’m not just talking about women, either. Sure the number of cases against men are significantly smaller but that doesn’t matter. Woman or man alike, being able to freely express oneself is paramount.</p>

<p>I think that’s what blogging’s good for: telling a story and sharing with others. On the Internet, one can hide behind a persona while still telling stories that are real, dirty, sad, exciting, or any combination thereof.</p>

<p>Now let’s bring it back in to my original point. If I’m sitting on a park bench one day, and there’s a conflict between someone or a situation is happening, in my mind, I would want to tell that person’s story. What happens to everyone is important. If I saw someone being beaten by anyone—not just a cop—I would want to share that with the world: “Hey everyone. This guy is going through stuff no one should have to experience. Let’s do something about it.”</p>

<p>Whether it’s the victim or a third party, telling stories people have would be a great way to connect us, bypassing our differences, and using our common struggles as a bond. When one person comes forward, more are likely to follow. Someone has to take the first step, however.</p>

    <p>When my favorite team (Seattle Seahawks) isn’t playing in the Super Bowl, I’ll still watch for the commercials. I enjoy an ad that tells a story, or makes me feel something. I won’t likely buy anything that ad was selling, but I don’t think it’s always about that. These multi-million dollar spots aren’t about selling stuff, they’re about creating a memory; if executed properly, you’ll remember that commercial for weeks, to come… something they can’t say about tv commercials every other day of the year.</p>

<p>Here’s a rundown of my favorites and why. Be warned: the list is long (I have many favorites) and there is a lot of feels… <em>a lot</em> of feels.</p>

<h2 id="dodge--wisdom">Dodge – Wisdom</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JKKlqMs19tU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>This is one of those ads that makes me stand up and clap. See, <a href="http://dodge.com">Dodge</a> makes <a href="http://dodge.com/cars">cars</a>. They make cars that <a href="http://dodge.com/charger">go fast</a>. They also make cars that are <a href="http://www.drivesrt.com">stupid fast</a>. They’re going through their 100 year anniversary. What better way to show off their fleet of ass kickers than to find 100 year old ass kickers to put you in your place! Grandpa doesn’t want you to be a little bitch. Rock on, grandpa. Rock on.</p>

<h2 id="bud-light--real-life-pacman">Bud Light – Real Life PacMan</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9A1NowrnGI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Anheuser-Busch steps up their game yet again with another bro who’s literally, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/upforwhatever">#UpForWhatever</a>. I’m sure some of this was scripted, but who cares. That looks like a party I’d want to go to. I might… just might… drink _one _Bud Light.</p>

<p>Part of me thinks those beefed up right arms aren’t for arm wrestling. Kinda weird.</p>

<h2 id="nfl--together-we-make-football">NFL – Together, We Make Football</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ul29X69UJA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Yeah we do. This basically sums up those tense, last-minute moments. Not super intense but pretty truthful, overall.</p>

<h2 id="doritos--when-pigs-fly">Doritos – When Pigs Fly</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQo0TfuueaY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>You know <a href="http://doritos.com">Doritos</a> would step it up again this year. They can’t not. They’ll stop making cool ads when pigs fly. Oh wait… crap.</p>

<h2 id="budweiser--lost-dog">Budweiser – Lost Dog</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAsjRRMMg_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Leave it to Anheuser-Busch take the crown for the feels award. They know lost puppies pull heart strings. They know how to pull them good, too. No, I’m not crying… I just got some Doritos in my eye.</p>

<h2 id="coca-cola--makeithappyhttptwittercommakeithappy">Coca-Cola – <a href="http://twitter.com/#MakeItHappy">#MakeItHappy</a></h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibgvkXm9Qkc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Coca-Cola gets a feels award, too, for this ad. In a world where we’re hating on each other day in and day out because hiding behind a computer screen on the Internet and trashing someone’s life makes you powerful. Pro tip: you look like an idiot. Good job, Coca-Cola for trying to remind people that hate doesn’t belong on the Internet, or really anywhere for that matter.</p>

<h2 id="dove--realstrengthhttptwittercomrealstrength--mencare">Dove – <a href="http://twitter.com/#RealStrength">#RealStrength</a> | Men+Care</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/devSIrBqC1Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>You’re not tired of the feels, yet, are you? Good. Dove knows that staying fresh and clean is important to raising children and being a good role model for them. I don’t have kids, but I can imagine it’d be hard to do so with a lingering stink.</p>

<h2 id="always--likeagirlhttptwittercomlikeagirl">Always – <a href="http://twitter.com/#LikeAGirl">#LikeAGirl</a></h2>

<p>The feels train is barreling into the station. Always makes a great point that girls in our society are at their lowest regrind their self-esteem. It’s no wonder so many turn out like they do.</p>

<h2 id="jeep--beautiful-lands--jeep-renegade">Jeep – Beautiful Lands | Jeep Renegade</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7LbPdzYrrE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>This is one of my favorite, for sure. It’s likely in my top three, now that I think about it. It’s long at 1:31, but it’s real. As someone who loves exploring and photographing nature and the world around me, I gravitate towards stuff like this. This is one of the few commercials in this list that makes me want to buy something like what they’re selling.</p>

<h2 id="clash-of-clans--revenge">Clash of Clans – Revenge</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GC2qk2X3fKA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I about died watching this. Liam Neeson is amazing and executes his Taken character so well. Loads of Internet points for this one.</p>

<h2 id="carnival-corporation--come-back-to-the-sea">Carnival Corporation – Come Back to the Sea</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xQ-HyzAgRk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I’ve never been on a Carnival cruise, but I really appreciate this spot. The lack of sound effects and listening to the speech along with powerful and sweeping images of cool places and things Carnival supposedly lets you do makes me appreciate it as a presentation more than an advertisement.</p>

<h2 id="eat24">EAT24</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BPJrgSCRpY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Are you hangry and inexplicably upset about your pants? Get <a href="http://eat24.com">EAT24</a>. The best motherf*cking way to order food online, baby. This wasn’t an ad that was aired in my market, but I wish it was. I love Gilbert Godfried.</p>

<h2 id="kia--the-perfect-getaway">Kia – The Perfect Getaway</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrjbGqrAyRk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Explosions. Drama. Pierce Brosnan. I need not say more.</p>

<p>I literally can’t even. Just watch it.</p>

<h2 id="toyota--my-bold-dad">Toyota – My Bold Dad</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1AB8zA7YOtw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Our break from the feels is over. Dad definitely was a theme across several of these commercials this year. There’s nothing wrong with that, at all. Here’s a few more feels.</p>

<h2 id="no-more">No More</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJaSj_qipic?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I’ll admit, I’ve been making jokes about the feels, but this one is no laughing matter. Yes, it’s heart-wrenching for some, but it damn well should be. Domestic violence is a real thing. Don’t pretend it’s not. Seriously.</p>

<h2 id="nissan--with-dad">Nissan – With Dad</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bd1qCi5nSKw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>The last of the dad-themed spots in my list. Nissan knows how to advertise their fleet and give a few feels at the same time. It had everyone in my party watching, even though we weren’t entirely sure what it was about at first…. but those feels…</p>

<h2 id="chevrolet">Chevrolet</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHS426cnNBA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>This last one had my butt puckering for a bit. With a decent sized gathering at my house to watch the game, the last thing I wanted was for Comcast to start trolling and cut my service. This commercial made me think my worst nightmare came true. Good job, Chevrolet, I’ll give you points for that… just don’t do it again.</p>

    <p>Music is one of those things: you either like it or you’re weird. Music for me is a way to eliminate the distractions surrounding me and enter the world the artist as created. Any genre of music can work. If it’s Taylor Swift, that world exists just as much as Vivaldi’s. As I write this, I’m actually just sitting back in my chair with my eyes closed. It’s good that I can type without looking (there’s always spell check, too).</p>

<p>Music is a gateway to your imagination. It stimulates your brain into opening up your creativity and letting flower new ideas and at the same time lets our hone in on existing ones. For some, music is purely claiming. For others it gets them amped up. I’m sure the type of music has something to do with that, no doubt. </p>

<p>When I get started early in the morning, Spotify gets started with me. If you’re not using Spotify or another service like it to get your music, you’re missing out. As buying CDs is dying, buying singles from iTunes or similar is dying. I pay the equivalent of two trips to Starbucks every month for unlimited music in all categories, for whatever listening events I desire. It’s the best $10 I’ve ever spent to help me focus. Now how do I return these brain drugs I bought off the TV?</p>

  <p>Based on a survey of 700 students, the study found that users who engage in “surveillance use”–“brows[ing] the website to see how their friends are doing compared with their own lives”–versus simply using the site to contact friends and family can experience symptoms of depression.<br />
—TechCrunchWell duh. One doesn’t need Facebook to get into the mindset of seeing another’s happiness and wish it was their own. This is why I advocate finding other sources of stimulation, like writing!

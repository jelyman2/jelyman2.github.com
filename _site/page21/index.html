    <p>This is my writing space. One would think that with my constant writing and seemingly never ending list of things to talk about, I’d have a super clean and awesome space to write that wasn’t the least bit distracting. Turns out, I’m not a super huge fan of minimalist spaces. I like having things to look at. When I’m pondering, it gives me something to study that ultimately leads me to my words. My last post about Dr. Better came solely because I was drinking one and the bottle was sitting right next to me. I could do to clean it up a bit, but I don’t feel that’s a super high priority. If was to organize my chaos a bit, those flowers wouldn’t move. That’s my wife’s wedding bouquet. She makes the final say on where that sits, and I kindly oblige. (Plus, she shares the desk, too, on occasion, so it’s only fair.)</p>

    <p>Let me tell you a story. A story about Dr. Better. See, Dr. Better wasn’t just good, he was better. Better than you and better than me. Dr. Better had a special talent. What was that talent, you ask? Why, being better, of course. </p>

<p>Now you might be wondering, exactly what was he better at? Let me tell you.</p>

<p>Dr. Better was better at being better… cola. </p>

<p>Cola?</p>

<p>Yes. Cola.</p>

<p>Dr. Better was better at Cola than anyone else who claimed to be better. One could argue Dr. Better was the best. Even if he was, he was still better.</p>

<p>Now that Dr. Better’s not a mystery, one could wonder if Dr. Better could be a better mystery, too…</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>The great advantage of being a writer is that you can spy on people. You’re there, listening to every word, but part of you is observing. Everything is useful to a writer, you see—every scrap, even the longest and most boring of luncheon parties. ~ Graham GreeneThere’s so much right with this quote. I won’t say I’m a spy, but I find other people’s conversations amusing. I’m also pondering something…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote got me wondering this morning what would happen if more people told their stories? There’s hardly a shortage of drama in the news today surrounding things like black rights, domestic violence, discrimination, education, and so on that if everyone told their story, I can’t help but believe something would actually be done about it.</p>

<p>Let’s think about this for a moment. There are X number of rape cases every year, right? (I leave the number as X because the quantity is irrelevant for this scenario) One of the biggest things surrounding rape and sexual assault is more often than it should be, the victim doesn’t come forward. What if the victim had a place to express their feelings without fear of being persecuted or being in danger? From a writing perspective and then from a sociological perspective, imagine how much more we’d hear about it? I’m not just talking about women, either. Sure the number of cases against men are significantly smaller but that doesn’t matter. Woman or man alike, being able to freely express oneself is paramount.</p>

<p>I think that’s what blogging’s good for: telling a story and sharing with others. On the Internet, one can hide behind a persona while still telling stories that are real, dirty, sad, exciting, or any combination thereof.</p>

<p>Now let’s bring it back in to my original point. If I’m sitting on a park bench one day, and there’s a conflict between someone or a situation is happening, in my mind, I would want to tell that person’s story. What happens to everyone is important. If I saw someone being beaten by anyone—not just a cop—I would want to share that with the world: “Hey everyone. This guy is going through stuff no one should have to experience. Let’s do something about it.”</p>

<p>Whether it’s the victim or a third party, telling stories people have would be a great way to connect us, bypassing our differences, and using our common struggles as a bond. When one person comes forward, more are likely to follow. Someone has to take the first step, however.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page21/" rel="bookmark" title="My Favorite Super Bowl Commercials">My Favorite Super Bowl Commercials</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">04 Feb 2015</time>
    <p>When my favorite team (Seattle Seahawks) isn’t playing in the Super Bowl, I’ll still watch for the commercials. I enjoy an ad that tells a story, or makes me feel something. I won’t likely buy anything that ad was selling, but I don’t think it’s always about that. These multi-million dollar spots aren’t about selling stuff, they’re about creating a memory; if executed properly, you’ll remember that commercial for weeks, to come… something they can’t say about tv commercials every other day of the year.</p>

<p>Here’s a rundown of my favorites and why. Be warned: the list is long (I have many favorites) and there is a lot of feels… <em>a lot</em> of feels.</p>

<h2 id="dodge--wisdom">Dodge – Wisdom</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JKKlqMs19tU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>This is one of those ads that makes me stand up and clap. See, <a href="http://dodge.com">Dodge</a> makes <a href="http://dodge.com/cars">cars</a>. They make cars that <a href="http://dodge.com/charger">go fast</a>. They also make cars that are <a href="http://www.drivesrt.com">stupid fast</a>. They’re going through their 100 year anniversary. What better way to show off their fleet of ass kickers than to find 100 year old ass kickers to put you in your place! Grandpa doesn’t want you to be a little bitch. Rock on, grandpa. Rock on.</p>

<h2 id="bud-light--real-life-pacman">Bud Light – Real Life PacMan</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9A1NowrnGI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Anheuser-Busch steps up their game yet again with another bro who’s literally, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/upforwhatever">#UpForWhatever</a>. I’m sure some of this was scripted, but who cares. That looks like a party I’d want to go to. I might… just might… drink _one _Bud Light.</p>

<h2 id="skittles--settle-it">Skittles – Settle It</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JDwRN2GBUj8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Part of me thinks those beefed up right arms aren’t for arm wrestling. Kinda weird.</p>

<h2 id="nfl--together-we-make-football">NFL – Together, We Make Football</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ul29X69UJA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Yeah we do. This basically sums up those tense, last-minute moments. Not super intense but pretty truthful, overall.</p>

<h2 id="doritos--when-pigs-fly">Doritos – When Pigs Fly</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQo0TfuueaY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>You know <a href="http://doritos.com">Doritos</a> would step it up again this year. They can’t not. They’ll stop making cool ads when pigs fly. Oh wait… crap.</p>

<h2 id="budweiser--lost-dog">Budweiser – Lost Dog</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAsjRRMMg_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Leave it to Anheuser-Busch take the crown for the feels award. They know lost puppies pull heart strings. They know how to pull them good, too. No, I’m not crying… I just got some Doritos in my eye.</p>

<h2 id="coca-cola--makeithappyhttptwittercommakeithappy">Coca-Cola – <a href="http://twitter.com/#MakeItHappy">#MakeItHappy</a></h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibgvkXm9Qkc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Coca-Cola gets a feels award, too, for this ad. In a world where we’re hating on each other day in and day out because hiding behind a computer screen on the Internet and trashing someone’s life makes you powerful. Pro tip: you look like an idiot. Good job, Coca-Cola for trying to remind people that hate doesn’t belong on the Internet, or really anywhere for that matter.</p>

<h2 id="dove--realstrengthhttptwittercomrealstrength--mencare">Dove – <a href="http://twitter.com/#RealStrength">#RealStrength</a> | Men+Care</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/devSIrBqC1Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>You’re not tired of the feels, yet, are you? Good. Dove knows that staying fresh and clean is important to raising children and being a good role model for them. I don’t have kids, but I can imagine it’d be hard to do so with a lingering stink.</p>

<h2 id="always--likeagirlhttptwittercomlikeagirl">Always – <a href="http://twitter.com/#LikeAGirl">#LikeAGirl</a></h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIxA3o84syY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>The feels train is barreling into the station. Always makes a great point that girls in our society are at their lowest regrind their self-esteem. It’s no wonder so many turn out like they do.</p>

<h2 id="jeep--beautiful-lands--jeep-renegade">Jeep – Beautiful Lands | Jeep Renegade</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7LbPdzYrrE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>This is one of my favorite, for sure. It’s likely in my top three, now that I think about it. It’s long at 1:31, but it’s real. As someone who loves exploring and photographing nature and the world around me, I gravitate towards stuff like this. This is one of the few commercials in this list that makes me want to buy something like what they’re selling.</p>

<h2 id="clash-of-clans--revenge">Clash of Clans – Revenge</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GC2qk2X3fKA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I about died watching this. Liam Neeson is amazing and executes his Taken character so well. Loads of Internet points for this one.</p>

<h2 id="carnival-corporation--come-back-to-the-sea">Carnival Corporation – Come Back to the Sea</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xQ-HyzAgRk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I’ve never been on a Carnival cruise, but I really appreciate this spot. The lack of sound effects and listening to the speech along with powerful and sweeping images of cool places and things Carnival supposedly lets you do makes me appreciate it as a presentation more than an advertisement.</p>

<h2 id="eat24">EAT24</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BPJrgSCRpY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Are you hangry and inexplicably upset about your pants? Get <a href="http://eat24.com">EAT24</a>. The best motherf*cking way to order food online, baby. This wasn’t an ad that was aired in my market, but I wish it was. I love Gilbert Godfried.</p>

<h2 id="kia--the-perfect-getaway">Kia – The Perfect Getaway</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrjbGqrAyRk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Explosions. Drama. Pierce Brosnan. I need not say more.</p>

<h2 id="loctite--positive-feelings">Loctite – Positive Feelings</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ha4k71AQqgA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I literally can’t even. Just watch it.</p>

<h2 id="toyota--my-bold-dad">Toyota – My Bold Dad</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1AB8zA7YOtw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Our break from the feels is over. Dad definitely was a theme across several of these commercials this year. There’s nothing wrong with that, at all. Here’s a few more feels.</p>

<h2 id="no-more">No More</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJaSj_qipic?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I’ll admit, I’ve been making jokes about the feels, but this one is no laughing matter. Yes, it’s heart-wrenching for some, but it damn well should be. Domestic violence is a real thing. Don’t pretend it’s not. Seriously.</p>

<h2 id="nissan--with-dad">Nissan – With Dad</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bd1qCi5nSKw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>The last of the dad-themed spots in my list. Nissan knows how to advertise their fleet and give a few feels at the same time. It had everyone in my party watching, even though we weren’t entirely sure what it was about at first…. but those feels…</p>

<h2 id="chevrolet">Chevrolet</h2>
<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHS426cnNBA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>This last one had my butt puckering for a bit. With a decent sized gathering at my house to watch the game, the last thing I wanted was for Comcast to start trolling and cut my service. This commercial made me think my worst nightmare came true. Good job, Chevrolet, I’ll give you points for that… just don’t do it again.</p>

    <p>Music is one of those things: you either like it or you’re weird. Music for me is a way to eliminate the distractions surrounding me and enter the world the artist as created. Any genre of music can work. If it’s Taylor Swift, that world exists just as much as Vivaldi’s. As I write this, I’m actually just sitting back in my chair with my eyes closed. It’s good that I can type without looking (there’s always spell check, too).</p>

<p>Music is a gateway to your imagination. It stimulates your brain into opening up your creativity and letting flower new ideas and at the same time lets our hone in on existing ones. For some, music is purely claiming. For others it gets them amped up. I’m sure the type of music has something to do with that, no doubt. </p>

<p>When I get started early in the morning, Spotify gets started with me. If you’re not using Spotify or another service like it to get your music, you’re missing out. As buying CDs is dying, buying singles from iTunes or similar is dying. I pay the equivalent of two trips to Starbucks every month for unlimited music in all categories, for whatever listening events I desire. It’s the best $10 I’ve ever spent to help me focus. Now how do I return these brain drugs I bought off the TV?</p>

    <p>One would think that because I’m a photographer in some capacity that I would take all of my own photos. Let me tell you, that’s certainly not the case. One cannot craft a particular scene in a heartbeat with just enough time to post it to a blog. Good luck with that. </p>

<p>Instead, I use a lot of creative-commons based stock photography. I thought I’d put together a list of sites I source my imagery from in hopes that it helps you in your journey to finding great images for your site.</p>

<p>I have several primary sources I rotate through, depending on what time of the week it is. Most of these sites only update once a week or month with a new “pack” of images.</p>

<h2 id="death-to-the-stock-photo">﻿Death to the Stock Photo</h2>
<p><a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com">DTTSP</a> has two models for delivering photos: free and premium. The free model allows you to receive photos in your email every month in a pack of about ten. They’re high quality images, large enough to print, even, if you so desired. With their premium model, you can get access to their whole archive, not just most recent images for $10 a month. I can’t say that about any big stock photo agency.</p>

<h2 id="unsplash">﻿Unsplash</h2>
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com">A side project</a> by the visual design agency Crew, you’re granted ten new photos every ten days to do whatever you want with. You can view their past images by scrolling and all are was to download right from the site, no membership or sign-up forms required. The images and their themes vary from week to week so don’t hesitate to scroll down a ways and get into past months’ photos.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.raumrot.com/10/">this site</a> because they have categories. A lot of them feel a bit hipster in style but that’s all the rage now from what the kids tell me. Most if not all of their images are hosted on flicker so they’re easy to download. All they ask is a bit of attribution.</p>

<p>While not as active anymore as some of the others, <a href="http://littlevisuals.co">their archive</a> is good. They’re not my first choice anymore since they don’t seem to be updating the site with new images, but their archives have a gem once in a while.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://nos.twnsnd.co">great place</a> for older images from the 1920s-1950s, and surrounding time periods. It’s amazing to look at some of these images as they’re genuinely pieces of history. </p>

    <p>Remember yesterday when I mentioned that AdBlock Plus was allowing companies to pay their way through the blocks to users? Turns out, that list is bigger than I led on. In fact, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/over-300-businesses-now-whitelisted-on-adblock-plus-10-pay-to-play/">it’s down right stupid long</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an e-mail to Ars, AdBlock Plus Communications Manager Ben Williams wrote that currently, the browser extension has granted a pass to “over 300 sites/entities” out of “over 1,500 applicants” to the company’s whitelist.Damn. Remind me again the point of AdBlock Plus?</p>

    <p>The words “vacate” and “vacation” seem to have two very different connotations in our mind. Looking at news articles tells us just that.</p>

<p><strong>Vacate:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Residents Forced To Vacate From Historic, Problem-Plagued Roseville Building— <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/02/01/residents-forced-to-vacate-from-historic-problem-plagued-roseville-building/">CBS13 Sacramento</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Vacation:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He Saved For Months To Buy His Wife A Dream Vacation. Her Happy Tears Say It All— <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/02/man-surprises-wife-vacation-video_n_6595506.html">Huffington Post</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>See what I mean? It’s actually a bit difficult to find an article about someone vacating their location and heading to Hawai’i, Milan, or Costa Rica.</p>

    <p>Today is the last day for The Unofficial Apple Weblog. TUAW has been a staple in keeping up with the latest Apple news, products and happenings. The site was always a go-to of mine to keep up to date on rumors, and it did its job well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TUAW, for lots of reasons beyond our control, has no future, but Apple’s burns brightly. It’s been great writing about these growing technologies, and seeing and testing apps — some that were great and some that fell short. All of us here tried to tell the story of Apple and its offspring of hardware and software companies and tell it straight; the good along with the sometimes ugly.— <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2015/02/02/some-final-thoughts/">Mel Martin</a>, TUAW</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re unsure of what that first sentence means let me translate: “TUAW doesn’t write enough fluff. Engadget and TechCrunch do. AOL wants to keep them because fluff pieces make more ad dollars. Without ad dollars, AOL will we all die.”</p>

<p>I can’t help but think that’s why TUAW and coincidentally, Joystiq are taking their final ride today and heading out to pasture. While the revolution of digital media killed off many a good magazine (read: Macworld, Cat Fancy), having a digital publication that people actually enjoy murdered quietly is tough, too. I’m sure TC and Engadget will have plenty of space for the staff from TUAW and Joystiq, but they’re just not the same. Both are end-all-be-all properties that try to cater to everyone and in turn they lose a sliver of their credibility as being the authority on specific things. I wouldn’t trust my local Wal-Mart with high-nor would I trust Radio Shack, either—and I think it’s hard to put faith into a site that tries to pull in 20-somethings for gadget news and then turn around and write about a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/mysecretluxury-is-a-concierge-service-for-romance-love-potentially-sex/">concierge sex service</a>. It never ended there, don’t even get me started on why <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/">a porn site</a> that really wasn’t that special was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/canadian-trio-creates-angel-funded-paintbottle-a-porn-site-for-the-21st-century/">newsworthy</a>.</p>

<p>To each their own, I guess. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have <a href="http://imore.com">iMore</a>, <a href="http://9to5mac.com">9to5Mac</a>, and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">ArsTechnica</a> to go read.</p>

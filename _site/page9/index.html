        Choosing Your Words
      </a>

    <time datetime="2015-05-04T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">04 May 2015</time>
    <p>We spend a great deal of time communicating via text. Some would argue we <a href="http://www.bizzuka.com/company-blog/we-never-talk-any-more-why-text-messaging-has-replaced-the-phone-for-communication">communicate more now than ever</a> before as a society, albeit a smaller percentage via speech. This is likely due to the proliferation of text-based communication methods like email, text messages, Skype, etc.</p>

<p>Granted, before email we wrote letters or talked on the phone. The problem with letter writing is that its not efficient for long conversations. We resorted to the phone for such things but even then a successful phone call required two people to be in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>With today’s digital communication, we can say what we want instantly to another person.</p>

<p>There’s a downside to all this, however, and I think Mark Twain made a good point well before digital communication was ever a thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The difference between the almost right word and the right work is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. ~ Mark TwainTwain’s statement can be conveyed in two ways: the way related to writing and being descriptive in said writing, likely for a book or short story, and the way related to making sure you mean what you say and say only what you mean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we have such instant access to communication, it’s easier than ever to say things without really meaning them. One can be incredibly hurtful and do real damage with little effort. It’s easy to “fly off the handle” at someone via text message because there isn’t a physical barrier preventing those words from instantly reaching someone. In the letter-writing or even telegraph days, one had to think about what they were saying before and during the writing phase. They then had to take that letter or telegraph somewhere to have it sent.</p>

<p>All this extra time serves as a good buffer period. With text messages, however, the moment one becomes upset at another, it takes two seconds to convey that anger and not give it a second thought.</p>

<p>This is where we as a society are lacking. We’ve developed ways of near-instantaneous communications with one another tens, hundreds, and thousands of miles away with next to no cost, but we’ve regressed sharply when it comes to what we say and how we say it. We see politicians “walking back” statements they make, we see hateful things written about others on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/12/new-harassment-policy-for-twitter/383344/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/116326365118751">Facebook</a>, we Snapchat our friends <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=snapchat+photo+leanks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#rls=en&amp;q=snapchat+photo+leaks">pictures that weren’t meant to be shared</a> without a second thought.</p>

<p>One can’t help but wonder what Mark Twain would say if he saw how careless we as a people have become when choosing our words.</p>

        Create High-Resolution Mockups for Your App or Site with Promotee
      </a>

    <time datetime="2015-05-03T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">03 May 2015</time>
    <p>When it comes to promoting your site or app, it’s important that your renders are high quality and accurately portray what your customers should expect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Promotee is a Mac application to create pixel-perfect and professional looking artwork for iOS, Mac and Android apps. Just drop a screenshot from your app onto a template in Promotee and our graphics engine will blend it into the template to generate a gorgeous looking result.Promotee has one goal: to do exactly what I said without breaking the bank of paying for renders or shooting your own devices, wasting valuable time. I sat down with the app and here’s how it went.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you launch the app for the first time, you’re dropped right into it with no fuss. You’re given an interface that allows you choose from iOS, Mac, and Android devices. By default, all three categories are selected under the “All” tab.</p>

<p>Over the top of the window is side-scrolling menu where you can choose the device and layout you desire. This list includes iPads in both horizontal and vertical arrangements, a three-way iPad setup, iPhones in both black and white, and more.</p>

<p>Because I’m about bullying testing it out, I took three screenshots of my homepage for the 3-way vertical iPhone arrangement. The middle image aligned properly, but the side two did not, leading to a less-than-ideal visual:</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-03-15.45.32.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-03-15.45.32.png?resize=882%2C699" alt="Screenshot 2015-05-03 15.45.32" /></a>Hoping that it was just a bug, I moved to a single device both vertical and laying flat, both iPhones. This time, I had success both times. All hope was not lost on this app. When dragging the image into the zone marked on our mock device, it took next to no time at all for the render to complete. I suspect this is because re-orienting an image within bounds is trivial. I don’t foresee any issues on even lightweight OS X systems like a Macbook Air. My Macbook Pro is four years old and it was just another day in the life.</p>

<p>Speaking of OS X devices, I wanted to see how well Promotee could churn out mockups of a Macbook Pro. I selected the Mac category and found a mockup of a Macbook Pro (non-retina) just like what I own.</p>

<p>Since we had trouble with the 3-way iPhone setup earlier, I wanted to try again with the 3-way iMac setup. Unlike our iPhone setup earlier, this mockup was flawless.</p>

<p>Android devices get some love, too, so don’t worry about that. If you’re looking for additional devices and you bought the App Store version, you can pick up the 5C/iPad mockup and the Macbook Air (perspective) mockup for $0.99 each via an in-app purchase. If you bought the app right from their site, you’ll have to go back to their site to get your mockups, still $0.99 each.</p>

<p>I’ve included images below from the app below that I created in the process of writing up this review.</p>

<p>All in all, this app is pretty slick. It does exactly what the developers claim it does, albeit with a hiccup here or there. I suspect whatever bug is plaguing the app will be fixed at some point in the future. For right now, It’s a maybe. It’s $4.99 on both the App Store and straight from their site. It’s possible that by the time you read this, whatever issue I experienced is now fixed. if that’s the case, I’ll update this article accordingly.</p>

        18 Resources for Getting Started with WordPress
      </a>
    </h1>
    <time datetime="2015-05-03T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">03 May 2015</time>
    <p>WordPress is one of the most popular blogging platforms and content management systems on the planet. Created by Matt Mullenweg and the team at Automattic, it’s an open source and free tool using PHP and MySQL for creating just about any kind of site you can imagine.</p>

<p>Today I’m going to cover a load of resources for getting yourself familiar with WordPress, what it can do, and how to expand and develop for it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Before we get into the technical stuff, we need to cover the basics. You won’t get very far if you don’t know how to install it or navigate its interface.</p>

<p><strong>The WordPress Codex</strong></p>

<p>This might be the single best starting point. Coming straight from the source, every single person new to WordPress needs to read the getting started guid on <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/New_To_WordPress_-_Where_to_Start" title="The WordPress Codex">the WordPress Codex</a>. This guide describes where to start from the very beginning: what a weblog is really all about. It continues from there to making a plan regarding your hosting situation, installation, setting up, working with themes and plugins, and finally getting into some more advanced topics.</p>

<p><strong>WPBeginner</strong></p>

<p>Another great beginner guide comes from WPBeginner.com. Like the Codex but more summarized, the <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-learn-wordpress-for-free-in-a-week-or-less/" title="WPBeginner WordPress Guide">guide from WPBeginner</a> gets you running WordPress “in a week (or less).”</p>

<p><strong>WordPress.com</strong></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a hosted solution, there’s always WordPress.com. With that comes a great guide on getting started there from the folks that make <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> happen. If you’ve never used WordPress before, <a href="https://learn.wordpress.com/quick-start-guide/" title="&lt;a href=">WordPress.com</a> – Get Going Fast” draggable=”false”&gt;this guide might be the single easiest way to get familiar with the software before diving into hosting it on your own.</p>

<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>
<p><strong>Hongkiat</strong></p>

<p>If you want a good overview on how to make a good quality plugin, <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-plugin-development/" title="Hongkiat">Hongkiat</a> has you covered. They cover basic folder structures, naming conventions, best practices, filter, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Tuts+ – Jeffery Way</strong></p>

<p>Jeffery Way has a crash course on plugin development in video format on <a href="http://Tuts+.com">Tuts+.com</a> and covers all the basics to make a good plugin. In this scenario, Way covers how they made an actual plugin to serve a real-world purpose and how he planned it out.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>Plugin development is only a small part of a sucessful and well-oiled WordPress site. the other portion is a quality theme. Why? Your theme is what peopel see and having it work properly and be as effecient as possible practially goes without saying.</p>

<h3 id="make">Make</h3>
<p><strong>WordPress Codex</strong></p>

<p>If you want to make your own theme, you can, should you have the proper front-end development skills. The Codex has a rather extensive <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons" title="Codex">list of lessons</a> on various elements of theme developments.</p>

<p><strong>Tuts+ – Sam Parkinson</strong></p>

<p>Another WordPress pro, Sam Parkinson, has a rather <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch--net-706">exhaustive tutorial</a> on creating a WordPress theme from scratch. Parkinson covers the structure of a theme, what the files should look like, and what various functions look like that you’ll likely be using.</p>

<h3 id="buy">Buy</h3>
<p>It’s ok to admit that you’re not good at developing WordPress themes. I’ll admit that, too. Here’s a list of my favorite theme developers.</p>

<p><strong>Ecko Themes</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://ecko.me">Their shop</a> doesn’t have a lot in it, yet, but the quality is great and the price points are exactly where they need to be. <strong>ElegantThemes</strong></p>

<p>This shop has been around for a while and <a href="http://www.elegantthemes.com">their list of themes is extensive</a>. At the time of this article, they have 87 themes that come as one large package for $69. That comes out to be around $.80 a theme. if you’re a developer or want lifetime access, you’re looking at still low prices of $89/year or $249 one time.</p>

<p><strong>Mike</strong>  <strong>McCallister</strong></p>

<p>He’s been in it for a while and his <a href="https://array.is/wordpress-themes/">collection of themes</a> serves a wide audience and great support comes with each theme. You can buy each theme individually or get access to the whole collection <a href="https://array.is/theme-pass/">for $199</a>.</p>

<h3 id="free">Free</h3>
<p>It’s also OK to go with a free WordPress theme if you’re finding what you looking for without spending any money. Frankly, WordPress themes can be expensive, too.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Themes</strong></p>

<p>The team behind <a href="http://modernthemes.net">Modern Themes</a> is shooting for creating quality themes that don’t cost money. Just because a theme doesn’t have a price tag on it, doesn’t mean it has to be sub-par. Modern Themes hosts a variety of themes that cost zero dollars, with premium options that offer up additional features for a fraction of the price of most premium themes.</p>

<p><strong>Anders Noren</strong></p>

<p>A swedish developer, <a href="http://www.andersnoren.se">Anders Noren</a> creates great WordPress themes, mostly for free. As someone who’s used several of this themes in the past, I can vouch for the quality.</p>

<p><strong>WordPress.org</strong></p>

<p>The WordPress Theme Directory is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">go-to repository</a> for every <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> approved theme. Each of the themes on this site meet strict quality standards and there are literally thousands to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>WordPress.com</strong></p>

<p>if you’re rocking a hosted WordPress site on WordPress.com, <a href="https://theme.wordpress.com">this site</a> will become a favorite for you. At least 345 themes are featured here of both free and premium varieties.</p>

<h2 id="extra-all-encompassing-video-courses">Extra: All-Encompassing Video Courses</h2>
<p><strong>Lynda.com</strong></p>

<p>If you like video training, <a href="http://lynda.com">Lynda</a> has just about anything you could hope for, including WordPress. Prices are great at least than $30 a month.</p>

<p><strong>Treehouse</strong></p>

<p>If you’re a fan of a <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/wordpress-development" title="Treehouse">track-based development course</a> that covers the whole gamut of WordPress development, Team Treehouse has a course you’ll be interested in. It covers the basics like going over the Codex, getting a local development environment set up, theming and templating, Bootstrap, customizing the administration panel, and more. It really is an all-in-one course. Treehouse isn’t free, but for $25/month, you can consume as many courses of their as you like.</p>

<p><strong>WordPress.tv</strong></p>

<p>Great <a href="http://wordpress.tv/">free training</a> and lectures from key players in the WordPress community. If you miss various WordPress events, you might also find them here.</p>

<p><strong>Udemy</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://udemy.com">Udemy</a> is good for more than programming courses. WordPress developement and administration is on their menu, too, and prices are hard to beat. <strong>WP101</strong></p>

<p>A great video library that you can browse on their site. Created by Shawn Hesketh, a 26-year freelance development guy, he’s made likely a literal ton of WordPress sites for his clients. His tutorials have helped over 100,000 people get into WordPress and build their own sites.</p>

        The Dad Bod
      </a>
    </h1>
    <time datetime="2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">02 May 2015</time>
    <p>I came across <a href="http://theodysseyonline.com/clemson/dad-bod/97484">The Dad Bod on The Odyssey Online</a> this afternoon that at first seemed like a joke but turned out to be completely legitimate.</p>

<p>There’s a look that (at least some) women are after called The Dad Bod look. Mackenzie Pearson explains the incredibly fresh term as such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dad bod says, “I go to the gym occasionally, but I also drink heavily on the weekends and enjoy eating eight slices of pizza at a time.” It’s not an overweight guy, but it isn’t one with washboard abs, either.After thinking about this for a moment, I came to realize that I probably fit in this category, so I continued reading. It’s unfortunate that this all seems to be sources from the teenage generation, but if anyone is going to make up a new trend, it’ll be those who source their vocabulary from The Urban Dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pearson runs off a few items on her list of why a Dad Bod isn’t a bad thing, and what women (I’m sure in a generalized way) like about the “look” that’s nothing more than you enjoy McDonalds but not for three people, daily. I won’t go over them all because that’d spoil the fun of reading the article yourself. The one I enjoyed the most is the last one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Girls tend to picture their future together with their guys early on. Therefore, if he already has the dad bod going on, we can get used to it before we date him, marry him, have three kids. We know what we are getting into when he’s got the same exact body type at the age of 22 that he’s going to have at 45.Gotta play it safe, right? I get it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking about myself, I realize I probably fit in this category. I’m 5’11”, 195lbs. I’m not super skinny but I’m also not of the plumber variety. This probably explains why my wife insists she’s ok with the less-than-chiseled look I have going on.</p>

<p>Reading the comments was nothing short of amusing, but this one stood out the most:</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-15.59.26.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-15.59.26.png?resize=689%2C98" alt="Screenshot 2015-05-02 15.59.26" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not going to lie, I could probably go for a run now and then. I might have gone over the 50% muscle-beer gut line a few steps but one thing’s for sure: I’m surely not going to plan out my bland-as-hell meals for the week and expect me to always be okay with pizza.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/04/30/what_is_the_dad_bod_america_s_leading_expert_explains.html">Slate interviewed Pearson</a> on what exactly a Dad Bod is and the responses she’s received from men and women alike.</p>

        Dart: Java-Free Android Apps
      </a>
    </h1>
    <time datetime="2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">02 May 2015</time>
    <p>Made by some folks from the Chrome V8 Javascript engine team, Dart tries to solve 20-year old frustrations of working with Java. A language created completely in house, it feels a lot like Python.</p>

<p>from ArsTechnica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being fast and responsive is one of the biggest goals for Sky. While 60FPS (or Hz) is the smoothness standard most devices and app developers aim for, the Dart team wants to crank that up to 120FPS, which isn’t even possible to display on the standard 60Hz smartphone screens we have today. That sounds rather improbable on Android, where many apps don’t stay at 60FPS, let alone 120. Rendering an app at 60FPS requires a frame to be drawn every 16ms, and apps “jank” or display an animation stutter, when they can’t keep up with the 16ms deadline.I know the feeling. I’ve experienced it myself many times when I used to own an Android device. I also am a fan of the word “jank.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Dart team brought along  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.domokit.sky.demo">a demo app</a>, and it was rendering entire frames in 1.2ms. While it was a simple example, it appears Sky has plenty of headroom for silky-smooth animation on more complicated apps and makes that 120FPS goal (8ms rendering time) seem like a possibility. The Dart team says Sky is “Jank-free by design” with APIs that don’t block the main UI thread, meaning that even if the app slows down, the UI will still be fast and responsive.Now that’s what I’m talking about. I’m not entirely sure why 120fps is necessary as they’re still struggling to get 60fps to run smooth. Baby steps, folks. Sure there’s nothing wrong with aiming high, but I’d hate to see this dropped because they never got to 120fps in real world use cases.</p>

      <a href="/2015/05/02/bulk-update-wordpress-meta/">
        Bulk Updating Any Meta Values in WordPress Posts Automatically
      </a>
    </h1>
    <time datetime="2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">02 May 2015</time>
    <p>I updated the look of my site, today, and with that came a non-standard setup for featured images and the realization I’d have to manually update a lot of posts.</p>

<p>The theme requires custom meta be used for the featured image setting to determine how to display an image. As of this post, I have roughly 170 blog posts in the database that would need updating from the beginning of January until now. I definitely didn’t want to spend the next 60 minutes (170 posts * time to click) updating each post, so I did a bit of quick and dirty PHP coding.</p>

<p>Placing the code within the_loop() allowed it to run automatically for each post that was presented. Setting the per-page post count to 200, I effectively had all 170 posts pushed on screen at the same time. This subsequently updated all 170 posts at the same time. This of course put a little bit of a hit on my SQL database, but not so much that it bogged it down. I’m sure having 170 * 2 reads then writes all at once blew out a few of the cobwebs. Most of this site is cached pretty effectively so the database doesn’t do much.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-18.23.56.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-18.23.56.png?resize=882%2C359" alt="Screenshot 2015-05-02 18.23.56" /></a></p>

<p>You’ll see in the image above where I made the updates. The first spike should have been the only one, but I entered the wrong value for one of the custom meta fields so I had to go back and do it again. The code has logic so if it was already correct, it skipped it, hence the smaller second peak.</p>

<p>If you’re curious, the above came from <a href="http://newrelic.com">NewRelic</a>, a service offering made by some pretty cool people. They’re free to use for the basic stuff and their customer service rocks. &lt;/shameless plug&gt;</p>

<p>Anyway, without further delay, here’s the code that made this happen:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/56c68169e85ae18ce62c.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/56c68169e85ae18ce62c">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p>Pretty neat, eh? I know it’s nothing spectacular but it gets the job done, for sure.</p>

        The Vox Media Open Source Meme Generator

    <p>I spent some time scouring GitHub this afternoon looking for cool projects. One I stumbled upon was a tool created by Vox Media for creating Twitter cards and Instagram images that included text, source, and site brand logo. I thought it was pretty interesting so I gave it a look-see and started it up in my own space.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’ll serve me much purpose and I haven’t seen Vox use it much if at all lately. It might have been a one-time use tool, probably around election time. If you’re interested in giving it a whirl, check it out their <a href="https://github.com/voxmedia/meme" title="Meme on Vox Media's GitHub page">GitHub page</a>, their <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/a/meme">running example</a>, or my <a href="http://mg.tools.jlyman.net">running example</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I’m not sure they totally get is that these image aren’t quite memes. <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com">These</a> are memes.</p>

        The Sad, Lonely World of Yik Yak

<p> </p>

<p>So I downloaded what some are calling the winner of the Secret-Whisper-YikYak battle for anonymous sharing. YikYak works like Whisper and Secret, except there’s one thing very different about it, at least from what I can tell.</p>

<p>After spending just ten minutes on the app, a trend started appearing. Actually, several trends. If you struggle with any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boys</li>
  <li>Periods</li>
  <li>Love</li>
  <li>ADHD Drugs</li>
  <li>General Sadness</li>
  <li>High School</li>
  <li>Drinking</li>
  <li>High School Drinking</li>
  <li>General High School Sadness</li>
  <li>Awkward First-Time Sex</li>
  <li>Awkward Butt Stuff
Then Yik Yak is for you. Ask your doctor about high-strength Yik Yak that involes constantly commenting on stranger’s life struggles with your own quips that likely have a nominal effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I noticed with Secret is that people seemed to as least be older than 15. I never tried Whisper so who knows what whack stuff went on there.</p>

<p>So when it comes to YikYak…</p>

<p>Enjoy. I think…</p>

        For-Profit Colleges
      </a>

    <time datetime="2015-04-30T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">30 Apr 2015</time>
    <p>It’s not really surprising that Corinthian Colleges shut its doors. It’s also not surprising that there are students out there who are angry the schools are closing.</p>

<p>I see two things come from this event.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone with pitchforks who hate for-profit colleges want to see them all burn.</li>
  <li>Too many students are upset because they’re now without a completed degree, but don’t understand their degree probably wouldn’t land them a job in the first place.
When it comes to for-profit education, it’s easy to lump all schools together. However they’re not all alike. In the case of Corinthian Colleges, their “campuses” were really just large commercial/retail spaces that taught very specialized material. Everest College was strictly medial, and WyoTech was strickly mechanical. These schools did not provide general post-secondary education in high-demand fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can typically tell what the overall end-goal of a for-profit college is by what it offers students. In Corinthian’s case, they jumped on the bandwagon carrying people who sat at home watching day-time TV and collected unemployment checks. I know, I used to be in that position. That was the only time of the day they advertised, likely for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s cheap to advertise mid-weekday in a market</li>
  <li>The best suckers are the ones who feel most vulnerable and use Jerry Springer episodes to feel better.
The second reason is likely a stretch and generalization, but there’s also a reason Jerry is only on mid-weekday in most markets.</li>
</ul>

<p>The people protrayed in the ads are those who Corinthian likely hoped would see them: single men and women of all colors who probably had families to feed and insane amounts of debt. They just want to do something good with their life, so why not medial billing or fixing something?</p>

<p>That sounds great, but neither are careers unless you plan on working for a large facility at some point in your life. In order to even be looked at, though, you’ll have to have a full degree from somewhere accredited.</p>

<p>Problems start seeping through the cracks right about now.</p>

<p>Employers cared very little about Corinthian school educations. If two people applied for one job and had all the same qualifications but one got their education at Everest, you know which one the employer will pick.</p>

<p>This became a real problem for a lot of students because the faux job placement assistance ended up being garbage. I’m sure there are a few out there who got jobs, but I doubt they got <em>good</em> jobs. A good comparison is the IT world. There’s a big difference between fixing computers at Best Buy’s Geek Squad for a career, making $12/hour and working on one of Google’s many systems engineering teams, likely making $75/hour.</p>

<p>I do want to say that not all for-profit schools are a waste of time. Quality comes down to what they offer, like I said before. That sounds counter-intuitive, but let me give a great example.</p>

<p>Argosy University. It’s parent company has had their name thrown around before related to other schools in their organization being less than ideal. Argosy University as a school, however, offers actual accredited degrees, however. Some facilities go as high as Ph.D. and Psy.D. level education with industry accrediation. Everest wouldn’t have ever reached that goal with the quality of education they provided.</p>

<p>While I’m sure Argosy’s parent company has had their fair share of exposure for “meh” educational offerings, in post-secondary education, it’s not always appropriate to throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>

<p>Before I wrap up, I want to make it perfectly clear that I used Everest/WyoTech and Argosy as examples because those are examples I am familiar enough with to use as comparisons. I wouldn’t promote or sponsor any of the schools or companies mentioned in this post even if I was paid to, because that’s not right and that’s not what I do on this blog.</p>

<p>I will also make sure to point out that Education Management Corp, the company that owns Argosy University, hasn’t been without its faults, but the level of investigation and potentially shady behavior has been limited to specific schools in specific areas, not the organization as whole.</p>

<p>So with that out of the way, keep an open mind, but don’t be stupid. If it sounds like its too good to be true, it probably is. In the case of Corinthian Colleges, everything they <em>said</em> they did was too good to be true and what they actually provided couldn’t have been farther from what was advertised.</p>

        Like That Zappos Guy

    <p>A couple days ago I talked about killing in people relations, a.k.a kicking ass at customer service. I suggested a book by Dale Carnegie called How to Win Friends and Influence People. I also said there was a second book I recommend.</p>

<p>That second book is by the CEO of Zappos, the site that sells a ton of shoes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JTHXN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003JTHXN6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=F2YCPEVVP25QDMQI">Delivering Happiness</a> isn’t just about learning how to smooth-talk through the phone or how to close a sale. It’s about making people feel appreciated. The book outlines what Tony Hsieh (pronounced shay) did and still does to make Zappos as awesome as possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pay brand-new employees $2000 to quit.</li>
  <li>Make customer service the responsibility of the entire company-not just a department</li>
  <li>Focus on company culture as the #1 priority</li>
  <li>Apply research from the science of happiness to running a business</li>
  <li>Help employees grow-both personally and professionally.</li>
  <li>Seek to change the world.</li>
  <li>Make money.
I took that list from Amazon’s description. They also feature a Q&amp;A with Hsieh that’s quite enlightening and definitely worth <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JTHXN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003JTHXN6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=F2YCPEVVP25QDMQI">checking out</a>. If you have an Kindle or a tablet, I suggest buying it that way as it’s cheaper than the Hardcover and Paperback, and it takes less space. If you’re like me and feel like taking a nap when you read, get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QADCNS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003QADCNS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=NTRBAV6C7SGGCZEJ">Audible version</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve read it already, let me know what you think.</p>

        Using Words
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-03-06T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>One thing I’ve always struggled with just a bit is my ability to translate my thoughts into words. When I write them down, I typically don’t have a problem. When it comes to speaking them, that’s where I falter from time to time.</p>

<p>There are times when I’ve been sitting in interviews and feel myself slipping into utter destruction and the only way to pull myself out was to craft some kind of visual aid. If I’m in a meeting room with a whiteboard, I’ll definitely take advantage of that because when I can draw out or otherwise illustrate what I’m trying to convey, I have a much better time actually saying it. A couple years ago, I had a technical interview that I would have otherwise failed if I hadn’t be able to illustrate the processes I was trying to describe that I was making up in my head as I went along.</p>

<p>Some people are really good with speaking. I’m not one of those people. What I want to say and what actually comes out are two different things.</p>

<p>Don’t even get me started on trying to start a presentation or other conversation where a lot of people are intently listening to me and waiting for words to come out of my mouth.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I had a to write a lengthly technical description of something, I’d bust it out in no time. As I’m writing this in fact, I’m not even looking at my screen, but instead outside the bus window at the traffic passing by.</p>

<p>Interviews have always been a struggle for me because there are so many things I want to say but being able to organize them as they come out verbally is something I’m not quite sure how to fix. When I’m interviewing with someone, I try to make it clear that my strength in explaining things lies with my words on paper (digital or otherwise). I can write directions for anything in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>There’s one key that makes this so easy for me: I can go back and review it.</p>

<p>I try not to edit my words as much as possible. Whatever I put down is typically the truth, even if it sounds shitty or a bit off. And when I say the truth, I mean the unfiltered thought. I don’t typically go back and censor what I’m saying either. I don’t have time nor do I actually care to. All I want to do is tell the world what I’m thinking.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if I should write technical documents for a living. Become a technical writer. I’m sure I’d do pretty well at that. I write a lot of documentation for the team I work on and manage on a regular basis. I’ve single-handedly created processes that people now blindly follow without a second guess because they believe that what I’m saying is true and is right. No one questions the directions I give them if I give them said directions written out.</p>

<p>Sometimes I get funny looks if I tell them how to do something verbally, though, and I totally understand.</p>

<p>As I reflect on situations like that, I realize I get ahead of myself in the process as I work through it in my head. Once I speak the words of event think about them, I’m already onto the next step. As I write, I can’t do that. I’m focused on placing one sentence at a time onto the digital or physical paper and don’t move on until I’m done.</p>

<p>Some would describe that as a very small sign of a mental disorder. I’m sure at least one person would say it’s OCD-like. Some would probably ponder a slight autistic quality about it.</p>

<p>Who knows. I might have any of those things. I know my younger brother is autistic. He’s terrible when it comes to interactions but that kid is damn smart. Growing up, he took to video games like flies and dog crap. He’s five years and change younger than me but he schooled me in just about any video game we played once he got the hang of the mechanics.</p>

<p>Once I got the hang of the mechanics involved in writing, I did the same thing.</p>

<p>I’m not super social, and I’m all right with that. I can spend all weekend in front of my computer writing about stuff and discussing topics with people I never see and not have a care in the world. I could also spend al weekend on the beach with my camera taking photos without speaking a word to anyone.</p>

<p>I bet if I was to do some more research on the autism spectrum, I’d probably find some qualities that I happen to possess. I’m sure we all do in some form or another, but that doesn’t make us autistic. The spectrum has become really wide and we put more and more people in it because of vaccines we don’t know how to classify them any other way.</p>

<p>I’m sure if a doctor told me I was slightly autistic, I wouldn’t care. I wouldn’t feel any different. It would explain my tendencies, but they’re mild enough that with enough effort from other angles, can be suppressed. Most days I just choose not to suppress them.</p>

<p>Take now, for example. Most days I’d be napping on the bus on my way to work because why not? Today, I decided to pack my laptop and continue writing. I didn’t get enough time this morning to write and I really enjoy it. A lot of people are sitting around me with their eyes closed, probably thinking about nothing. I’m sitting here bettering myself through words. I call that a big win.</p>

<p>Now that this paragraph puts me at a thousand and four words for a rather simple topic, I want to close with this one thought: as a society we try to make everything black and white; I’m super guilty of this. We’re not black and white creatures, though. There are literally an infinite number of facets to each and every one of us.</p>

<p>Don’t put someone down because of their inability to do something particularly well. I’d bet you ten bucks in whatever currency you use that there’s a variant of that skill they’re really good at. In my case, I’d hate to speak publicly because I’m not that good at improvising. I could write a speech for someone in no time at all and master the hell out of it.</p>

<p>We’re all incredibly different. Remember that.</p>

        Office for Mac 2016 Preview
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-03-06T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>When I heard the news today that the long awaited Office for Mac update was close at hand and a preview was available, I was pretty excited.</p>

<p>Downloading the installer was painless. At 3GB, it’s hefty. On install, it takes more space than that, at 5.6GB, but not more than I would expect. Don’t let the installer fool you, though. Even if you only have just that amount of space, it won’t let you continue unless you’re at least 2x over that.</p>

<p>The installer took about five minutes to run, and I was in business. I can’t say I’ve been able to install Office on a Windows machine in five minutes, that’s for sure.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-word">Microsoft Word</h2>
<p>I fired up Word first, as that’s a program I use a lot. I put Word 2011 and 2016 side by side to get a view of what it used to look like and what it looks like now.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0519.07.511.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>I grabbed APA paper templates from their respective start screens to use as demonstration documents. The templates aren’t the same (the 2016 templates are easier to search through) but you get the idea. Right form the get go, I’m already enjoying the new UI and its color scheme for 2016. I don’t appreciate the fact that 100% makes the document super small on my screen, but I suspect that’s the product of my screen resolution compared to its size. It’ll be another case where I zoom to 200% to get the screen usage I want.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0604.57.101.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0604.58.151.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Beyond that, the ribbon area is largely the same as it is in Word 2013, and as someone that uses Word 2013 a lot on a regular basis for work, this pleases me.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ribbons1.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using word was as smooth as I would expect it to be. Even the default font that appears in Office for Windows looks good on a Mac. I mean really good. Sometimes I wonder what the heck is going on in Windows when it comes to fonts.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.05.161.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="microsoft-excel">Microsoft Excel</h3>
<p>When I started Excel, the first thing that jumped out at me was the new start window. It’s simple, and I like simple. Not much else to say there. Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all have this same opening screen to start you off on.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.07.111.png?resize=860%2C558" alt="" /></p>

<p>Working with spreadsheets is as typical of work as it gets in Excel and you either like doing them or you don’t. I use excel a lot at work, too, and 2016 feels very similar, which is quite nice. Everything renders just like I’d expect it to and everything is in roughly the same place.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.08.201.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>I won’t go into the same level of detail as I did with Word. I don’t feel like there’s a need to repeat myself.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-powerpoint">Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>Ahh, the Keynote competitor. If you’re running a Mac on a daily basis, you’re familiar with Keynote, for sure. PowerPoint is the presentation god in a Windows-based business environment and I’m sure Microsoft wouldn’t mind sucking up a good user base in the OS X environment, too.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.12.481.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here I am saying it again with PowerPoint: the interface is very similar to its Windows counterpart. Now that I’ve said that for the third time, I’m sure you’re tired of hearing it.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-outlook">Microsoft Outlook</h2>
<p>Outlook is one of those email apps that if you need it, you absolutely can’t live without it. of these apps, this was the only one that needed time to prepare. I was running the earlier preview of Outlook and because of that it needed to upgrade its database.</p>

<p>I can’t really show you what I see in Outlook as I have work emails in it and I really don’t want to share that stuff. Here’s an image from Microsoft, instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Office-2016-for-Mac-5-1024x600.jpg?resize=882%2C517" alt="" /></p>

<p>While trying to clean up my email accounts in Outlook, it ended up freezing, which is definitely not good. I had the same issues with it before the whole 2016 suite preview was released so there’s still some work that needs to be done.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-onenote">Microsoft OneNote</h2>
<p>OneNote is Microsoft’s answer to Evernote and the like. Unfortunately it’s not a good enough answer. While it doesn’t cost extra money to use Onenote, you can’t really get all the features you can with Evernote. Document conversion and searchable PDFs are a pipe dream for sure and even though things like that cost money with Evernote, it’s a small price and well worth the effort. OneNote syncs with OneDrive which is great if you enjoy OneDrive. Otherwise, you’re out of luck when it comes to storing your notebooks. I suppose Evernote stores your stuff in its cloud storage area, too, which isn’t much different.</p>

<p>OneNote was also quite slow to start, too. If you’re an Evernote fan, I suggest you stick with it for now. There’s nothing in OneNote that would make we want to switch over.</p>

<h2 id="the-cloud">The Cloud</h2>
<p>Everything is in the cloud now, whether we like it or not. Each of these apps no longer require a serial number to activate, but instead just an active Office 365 subscription. I know what you’re thinking, you don’t like the idea of paying ‘membership fee’ or an ‘access fee’ to use your Office. What that sounds like to me is you not understanding how software EULAs work. Software is never really yours to begin with, you are just granted access to it. In this particular case, access is granted on a month-to-month basis, and is cheaper overall than paying outright. Office for Mac 2011 is $139. A single Office 365 license is $60 a year and comes with OneDrive storage out your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. This subscription model’s savings is realized even more when you find out you can use the Windows version, too, for no extra charge. Office 2013 costs upwards of $400 retail. Doesn’t sound like too bad of an offer, now does it?</p>

<p>If you’re a student, you’re automatically given a free O365 license. Free office is awesome, and definitely not worth complaining over, even if it isn’t a one-time payment, anymore.</p>

<p>Keep in mind you can purchase a subscription up front for a year, too, if you still really want to hold on to some semblance of the old days.</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>I’m sure you’ve realized that Microsoft’s choice to make the UIs as similar as possible was intentional. Cross-platform support is a real thing now at Microsoft and Office for Mac isn’t just some side project somewhere. OS X and iOS are real platforms in their eyes now and the updates reflect that.</p>

<p>I’m sure Microsoft appreciates your feedback. On the top right corner of every app is a smiley. Click on that bad boy and send them your feedback about the application you’re using. If you’re not a fan, tell them. If you are, tell them that, too.</p>

<p>With this major shift, I suspect Office for Mac will receive more regular updates that don’t take five years to cultivate. Microsoft’s Office for Mac team needed a huge culture shift and they received it under the transition from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella. Apple platforms aren’t a joke, anymore.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-06T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>I came across <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com">this site and program</a> yesterday, a coding camp for girls. While I’m not a girl, I feel like I can still appreciate the idea of such a thing. If I had daughters, I’d want them to give this a shot. As much as we don’t want to admit it, girls aren’t all about ponies and princesses. It’s about creating better ponies and princesses through agile development practices. LOL.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I’ve made a joke about an actual program that does good work, <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com">App Camp for Girls</a> is something I could get behind. We don’t have enough girls and women in STEM fields in the educational world nor in the professional world. Personally, I want to see more women as software developers.</p>

<p>Of course this would imply that the frat house environment that a lot of startups end up having because they’re 90% dude would have to end. You might be a startup, but you need to grow up. Don’t tell me that’s just how startups are… that’s deflection. </p>

<p>I don’t doubt there’s still an issue surrounding the equality of men and women in society. Look at gamer gate: a bunch of probably gross nerds sitting in their parent’s basements railing on women because they’re women and misogyny runs rampant in their lonely lives. </p>

<p>I’m excited to see where <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com">App Camp for Girls</a> expands to. They’re already rocking the North West with events in Vancouver, BC, Seattle WA, Portland, OR, and even Central NJ (which is definitely not in the NW).</p>

    <p>Last night while I was browsing <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, I came across a rather exhaustive list of free things startups can use in one capacity or another. <a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-startups-and-entrepreneurship/300-awesome-free-things-e07b3cd5fd5b">300 Awesome Free Things</a> covers everything and ended up become its own website: <a href="http://freebie.supply">Freebie.Supply</a>.</p>

<p>Freebie.Supply covered Business, Marketing, Design/Code, Productivity, and Learning tools that are essentially 100% free. It’s really quite a great resource to poke through and see what you can take advantage of right now, without having to put out a single penny.</p>

<p>That’s all I have for right now. A busy day is ahead of me. Keep up the good fight and continue working on whatever you’re doing to improve your quality of life.</p>

        Recovering From Failure, Part 2
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-03-04T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</time>

    <p><a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/failure" title="Recovering from Failure">Yesterday</a>, I spent a few minutes spilling my guts about a recent failure. It felt good to get it out there and the support and helpful words I received made it feel less painful. Failing sucks and it’s hard to swallow the truth that you’ll fail at something you think you’re good at.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve had a little bit of time to look back on it, I see it in a more neutral light. While I’m certainly still bummed out, it’s not affecting me like it did yesterday and the day before. Truth be told, I’m just one of many. My story isn’t unique or groundbreaking. Even the smartest of people fail at things from time to time. It’s what they do afterwards that makes a difference.</p>

<p>This failure event was timed perfectly. After listening to <a href="http://john.do">John Saddington</a>’s first podcast show thing called <a href="http://blog.desk.pm/ati-001/">Ask The Indie</a>, it got me thinking. What am I doing to continually enrich myself, not just in my regular studies but in my career? I want to be in a better position in five years, a year, even six months from now, doing more of what I enjoy: making things that people see.</p>

<p>(Aside: part of the reason why I chose a self-hosted option for running this site, based on <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I could used a hosted platform and I would probably enjoy it, but that’s not what I’m about.)</p>

<p>I made a decision last Friday that every weekday, I would spend one hour doing something that enriched my technical knowledge bucket in my head and can be used to further my career (when combined with other essential pieces). This is where the site <a href="http://trueability.com">TrueAbility</a> comes into play. I’ve known about them for some time but always looked at them like they were just a performance/technical assessment type site for job hunters. While that’s certainly true, there’s more to their offerings.</p>

<p>One of the cool things they offer are a lot of “101” courses on technical matters, typically surrounding development, Linux, WordPress, and other SysAdmin-y type things. They’re free to use and if you’re looking for a job, they have listings, too. Take one of their performance tests with questions chosen by the employer and they’ll send your results straight to them and likely put you on a shortlist compared to taking the traditional route of submitting a resume.</p>

<p>I really enjoy their platform and how quickly one can get started. The catch is everything is done via the command line so get comfortable with SSH/Putty, Linux, and other non-Windows development processes. Did I mention the tests are timed? I didn’t? Oh, well they’re timed. Most are 60-90 minutes in length. If you’re taking a performance assessment created by a potential employer, it would behoove you to not get hung up on one thing you can’t figure out. If you spend all your time on one problem and never move on to the rest, it’ll bring your score down. Each question is not all or nothing in most cases so come back to it and complete some of the other tasks, instead. It’ll make a big difference, I promise. Getting an 80% is much better than getting a 20% because you spent all your time on the first of five tasks.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, the real trick is to never give up and to never stop pushing forward. The proverbial horse will always be there to get back up on, that apple cart isn’t going to leave without you, and take advantage of <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/settling">your support system</a> if you have one. It’ll help immensely. <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support" title="My Support">It’s helping me</a>, quite a bit.</p>

<p>In other news, I received contact for an interview with another company, yesterday, so that also did quite a bit to boost my spirits. In my case, there’ll be all “no” responses until I get a yes. That’s just how it is.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-03T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">03 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>Yesterday, I failed. I failed pretty hard. It hurt a lot.</p>

<p>As you may well know, the search for a new job in San Francisco is on. A recent application I placed with a company I very well respect and admire got a response. They sent me a performance assessment to run through. I thought this would be an amazing time to shine.</p>

<p>Turns out, there was no shining to be had. I bombed it spectacularly. By the end of the hour, I likely received the worst possible score the test is capable of, short of not taking it at all. What’s worse, I went into it thinking I would be able to master it since it’s in my field. It’s stuff I know how to do.</p>

<p>Or so I thought.</p>

<p>My experience and views towards my experience came into question quite thoroughly. I’m not completely over it, yet, as the impact was greater than most rejections because of the company in question. I had my heart set on working for an awesome company on an awesome product that I really enjoyed, myself. Now that likely won’t happen.</p>

<p>My wife tells me it will be alright, and while it’s hard to agree with that right now, she’s right. There’s another test waiting for me that I haven’t started yet. I’m not sure if I’ll actually take it. I don’t know if I want to go through what I went through yesterday, one more time. Sure there’s a chance I can ace it, but that still doesn’t really show I’m qualified.</p>

<p>I’m going to mull this over, today, and see how I feel. If I decide to take it, I’ll do it tonight. Whether I pass or fail, it’ll make a good story to write about, tomorrow.</p>

<p>Now’s the time to recover from this failure. It still stings, but I can still build back up that foundation I’m standing on and keep the hunt going. It’s not something I’ll forget easily, but it’s a fact of life. Part of turning pro is accepting failures and moving on from them as they happen. Sometimes shit really does happen and there’s nothing you can do about it. In my case, more education and experience could possibly have fixed my situation, but that’s not a for sure notion.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-02T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">02 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>I took the weekend off from blogging. It’s the first time in a while that I haven’t posted something, even just a link. I wanted to take time and focus on myself and personal enrichment. Because I’m looking for a new job since we’re moving, it was fitting that I spend most of my time in that category, including education. I spent all weekend working on my CCNA and sprucing up my Linux deployment skills. It’s nothing too exciting, but I did learn that NodeJS is a little memory leaker, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>I started a <a href="http://dev.jlyman.net">dev blog</a> running Ghost, just for kicks, and let it sit. It gets zero traffic, but NodeJS keeps using more memory. I feel it’s one of those things that’ll eventually use as much as it can and deal with the repercussions later. I am not thrilled. I’ll keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Needless to say I’m back on the horse for the week ahead. Next weekend will likely yield the same set of tasks, but I might sneak in a post or two.</p>

    <p>Samsung <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/galaxy-s6-and-s6-edge-hands-on-samsung-finally-builds-a-premium-smartphone/">announced the Galaxy S6</a> over the weekend. It looks pretty slick, and oddly like an iPhone. The only problem: it runs Android.</p>

        Shot on iPhone 6

    <p>Apple has a new page on their site titled “ <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/world-gallery/">Shot on iPhone 6</a>.” This collection of photographs feature some of the best images taken with an iPhone 6. Of course, low light is still uncharted territory for the iPhone and you probably won’t see any of them in this mega gallery. I only got through roughly two dozen photos before I realized how long the list actually is. </p>

<p>For your <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/world-gallery/">viewing pleasure</a>.</p>

    <p>We all make mistakes, right? That’s not just me?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mistakes are the portals of discovery. ~ James JoyceTo err is to be human, and even though we’re always striving for greatness, sometimes we falter. It’s what happens when you’ve hit bottom that counts.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, don’t give up. That’s a mistake all in itself.</p>

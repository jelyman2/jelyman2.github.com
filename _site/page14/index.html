    <p>I thought I would use it, I really did. I like <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> as a platform but it’s just not where I want it to be, right now. Perhaps in a year or so, I’ll give it another shot with serious intentions.</p>

<p>In other news, the <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> agent monitoring it sucks up memory like a Dyson vacuum. For an app that literally is doing nothing, New Relic’s NodeJS agent sure seems to look like it’s doing a lot of work.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, I need my RAM back. It’s nothing personal.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I really like New Relic as a whole. They watch over my PHP environment, nginx and MySQL servers, and my server as a whole on the resource and load level for free. That’s pretty good in my book. Plus, all those agents seem to be playing nice, so they can stay.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-11T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">11 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>The Apple Watch was formally announced on Monday. Part of me cares, part of me doesn’t.</p>

<p>I like the idea of the Apple Watch. I like the way the stainless steel watch with the metal link band looks. I buy regular watches that look like that. Too bad it’s $1000.</p>

<p>It’ll be hard for me to justify that kind of price tag. I look at what the Apple Watch allegedly can do, and I think to myself that I’d never use any of that. I like the idea of fitness trackers, and I like watches. If the Apple Watch was half the price, if I could get the watch I described for $500, instead, I’d buy it.</p>

<p>Because I can’t, though, I’m looking for alternatives. This is where <a href="http://withings.com">Withings</a> comes in.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6.Withings_Activite_silver_side.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6.Withings_Activite_silver_side-1024x683.png?resize=660%2C440" alt="6.Withings_Activite_silver_side.png" /></a></p>

<p>I’m really enjoying the look of the Activité. It’s a simple device that does exactly what I want at a price tag that’s reasonable. The analog style is great and the battery life is outstanding.</p>

<p>I’ve never 100% liked having a watch on one hand, and a FitBit on the other. I like my FitBit, but I’d like to wear it on my left arm… except my watch is there.</p>

<p>I smell a birthday gift to myself coming soon.</p>

<p>If my wife ever reads this: Wife, this is what I want for my birthday.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page14/" rel="bookmark" title="The Stack">The Stack</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-03-10T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">10 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>Yesterday someone asked me what my stack looked like.</p>

<p>Today I think it makes a good blog post.</p>

<p>I’m always open to share the tech behind my sites and this one is no different. While not incredibly in depth, here’s how it goes:</p>

<h2 id="layer-1-infrastructure">Layer 1: Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The core of it all is DigitalOcean. They provide the resources my site sits on and so far they’re doing amazingly well. If I ever need more space or resources, I just need to click a few buttons and I’m on my way. I could also set up load balancing, too, with little effort if it comes to that. Their claim to fame are their awesome little (or big) droplets that start at $5. For $5 you get 512mb of RAM 20GB of SSD-backed storage, and 1TB of bandwidth. That’s enough for a small, site, for sure. I’ve moved higher than that mainly because of one member of my software stack that naturally uses more RAM. I’ll cover it later.</p>

<h2 id="layer-2-operating-system">Layer 2: Operating System</h2>
<p>Within my DigitalOcean home, Ubuntu 14.04 sits. I’ve chosen the LTS branch because I’m very much of a set-and-forget mentality when it comes to supporting architecture. I like the idea of not having to worry about my OS becoming outdated in a short window of time. It’ll effectively be supported until 16.04 comes out, and to give you an idea of when that is, 14.10 is currently the newest in line and 15.04 isn’t slated until the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-developments-15-04-beta-1-and-the-first-ubuntu-phone/">end of April</a> for a release date. In essence, I’m good until at least April 2016. </p>

<h2 id="layer-3-web-server">Layer 3: Web Server</h2>
<p>Presenting all of these bits is hard work. That’s why I chose nginx to take up the task. It’s a great server application that I’ve combined with SSL to make every visit to <a href="https://jlyman.net">https://jlyman.net</a> secure. Minimal configuration is needed in order to make things hum along smoothly, and I’m glad for that.</p>

<h2 id="layer-4-12-interpreter">Layer 4 1/2: Interpreter</h2>
<p>PHP. Given I run WordPress, this is a given. However there are several ways to run it. In my case, I’ve taken then PHP5-FPM route. I could also use FastCGI (the more generic form of FPM) or MOD_PHP (which is actually not that fast in today’s environments). FPM allows me to keep PHP from sucking up too many resources and limiting its worker count. If something gets stuck, I can gracefully shut it down and bring it back up without any major headaches.</p>

<h2 id="layer-4-22-database">Layer 4 2/2: Database</h2>
<p>This one is also a given because I run WordPress. MySQL is on the back side hosting the actual content of this site. It’s backed up every hour for good measure and backups are stored in a safe place that can be reached via the outside. There are much more efficient databases however getting WordPress to work with them is rough going if not impossible at this time and I don’t see much changing any time soon.</p>

<h2 id="layer-5-wordpress">Layer 5: WordPress</h2>
<p>This is the cream on top. WordPress is my CMS of choice and it’s one I’ve used for several years. I remember when I first started using it back on version 2.5. WordPress has come a very long way and I’m grateful that development of such a product continues today with a massive community behind it. </p>

<h2 id="layer-6-cloudflare--ssl">Layer 6: CloudFlare + SSL</h2>
<p>On top of all this, CloudFlare + SSL takes care of all my caching needs. They’re very intelligent about what can be cached and what’s dynamic. I have yet to run into a case where stale content has been served. With their system comes continued use of SSL. This means that from the server to their server is secure, and from their server to you is also secure, no questions. DDoS efforts are limited quickly and geographic-dependencies are removed. Wherever you are, you’ll get quick load times and a lot of burden is taken off my system, which keeps my costs low. I love keeping costs low.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-07T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">07 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>I’ve been on this kick for the last few days about women in the software development world, or even the lack thereof. Some of it is based off of what I’ve witnessed, and some of it comes from personal experience.</p>

<p>I work in an environment that’s mostly men. I also work in a rather large company that has several buildings where people get shuffled around from time to time. Recently, a new team took up some empty space in my building and after seeing our new tech residents, I became disappointed with what crossed my mind: “wow… she’s a developer?”</p>

<p>Now that I’ve effectively made you think I’m a complete douche and that I think women should be in the kitchen, let me explain.</p>

<p>First off, I think the level of female participation in STEM careers is awesome, especially technical fields like software development. There are a lot of bright female minds out there that I’m sure have crazy cool ideas and are just as good if not better at programming than a man.</p>

<p>I reflected a bit on what happened and I came to realize, that thought didn’t cross my mind because she’s a woman, but because she wasn’t nerdy-looking.</p>

<p>As a society, we’ve developed a stigma with software developers that they’re typically the nerdiest of the group and spend all of their time in front of a computer screen “hacking” or some crap like that.</p>

<p>While a man might not care so much about his image, a woman most likely will. To be feminine in a technical role is to ask for trouble. Take this particular article on Medium titled “ <a href="https://medium.com/@sailorhg/coding-like-a-girl-595b90791cce">Coding Like a Girl</a>.” I wanted to pick it apart for a bit and point out some rather sad truths about the state of the developer union.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t tell you how many people, when meeting me and hearing my profession, tell me that I look like a designer, someone in accounting, someone in marketing, anything but a programmer.This. If nothing else sticks through the rest of this post, consume this sentence. We’ve crafted an ideal female in various positions. In marketing, she’s probably going to be hot, skinny, likely blonde, and can sell you the air you’re already breathing. She knows how to pitch a new product and she makes good eye candy for the guys. If she was a developer, though, she’s probably just wearing a Zelda t-shirt and jeans, because that’s just what developers do, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/triketora">Tracy Chou</a>, an engineer at Pinterest, shared this story with me: A couple years ago she attended a technical conference and on the first day, she wore a dress. When she walked around the conference, no one came up to talk to her. When she asked people very technical questions about their stack, questions she assumed would indicate that she was a programmer, she was brushed aside and told, “ <strong>You wouldn’t understand</strong>.” She went back home that night really frustrated and flustered. She almost didn’t feel like going to the conference the next day. But she did and wore a nerdy t-shirt and jeans instead, and she had a better experience that day. People assumed she was technical and didn’t dilute their explanations to her.Not only have we come to a point where people can’t be pretty, but now they’re pretty stupid. It’s sad, really. I added my own emphasis to the above story because I want that statement to stick out. Telling someone they wouldn’t understand, regardless if they’re a woman or a man or a five year old is degrading. If you’ve told someone that, go die. I’ll admit, I’ve said that myself, and I hate myself for it. It’s an old habit that needs to die super hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who cares if someone doesn’t understand. Don’t be a pompous asshole and explain it to them. You never know the level of curiosity or interest someone has. Maybe you’ll end up being the gateway for them to broaden their skill set or learn something new. Instead, you just put them down. Way to go.</p>

<p>The author goes on to talk about how people have said to her that acting like a woman is distracting. When I read this part, I actually chuckled a little bit that someone would even say that. I’m not entirely sure what do say about this besides something along the lines of “keep it in your pants.”</p>

<p>I want to let you finish reading the article yourself, because I think it’s important that you get this from the source, from someone who’s experienced this firsthand. I’m a guy, so I’ll never know what it’s like to end up feeling second-class just because I have boobs. Yeah, I have boobs, but my wife isn’t dying to see them, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>To all the women out there who are actively pursuing what they want and aren’t fussing over making sure they don’t look too good or who aren’t dumbing down themselves and their looks to fit in and not rock the boat, good for you. Feminism was created out of the exact issues you’re going against. Instead of conforming, continue reforming.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page14/" rel="bookmark" title="Failure, Part 3">Failure, Part 3</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-03-07T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">07 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>Recently, I discussed a recent failure of mine that hit home pretty hard. You can read <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/failure" title="Recovering from Failure">part one</a> and <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/failure-part-2" title="Recovering From Failure, Part 2">part two</a>, first, if you’d like, but it’s not necessary. Today another important event happened that goes well with this impromptu series I’ve started and I want to talk about it.</p>

<p>Every day contains a new measure of varying successes. From the very beginning whether we get up in the morning on time and how many times we hit the snooze button, to whether we make it to work on time because of an accident on the freeway, to if we prepared enough for the meeting with the big cheeses.</p>

<p>Let’s be honest about something. Failure isn’t a thing.</p>

<p>Whoa, wait what?</p>

<p>Says who?</p>

<p>Me.</p>

<p>As someone who’s “failed” many times you and I should very well know by now that sometimes shit happens. That doesn’t make any one thing a failure.</p>

<p>We define failure as a threshold. Beyond X percentage of things going according to plan, we’re succeeding at something. Below X, we’re failing. This starts early in life with school. The archaic grading system we still use today—because if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right?…right?…guys?—tells us if we’re 100% correct on whatever menial task we’re completing, we’re performing admirably. If we only complete 59%, we’re failures.</p>

<p>Well damn.</p>

<p>I’m no rocket scientist but I think we’re on to something and it’s surely not rocket science.</p>

<p>This rather feudal method of ranking each other sets everyone up for failure. We carry it through life and it becomes how we go about our day. Maybe we’re not getting a grade on how quickly we showered, but we’re still looking internally and ranking ourselves.</p>

<p>We just use the words “today sucked.”</p>

<p>We have this system so ingrained in our minds and in our ways of life that after a point, we just say “I give up” or “I’m over it.” It becomes easy to care none because we not only have this mindless scale, but we automatically think that once we cross the point of no return, it’s better to blow the rest off.</p>

<p>That would certainly be the case in school if you didn’t have a passing grade and there wasn’t enough time or “things” left to do to possibly raise the score… 20th century education at its finest.</p>

<p>I keep going back and bashing on the educational system and in all honesty, that wasn’t my original goal when I started writing this. Things just kind of turned that way as the pieces started falling into place.</p>

<p>Failure is a completely synthetic thing. Failure is only measurable because we as humans believe we need to measure it.</p>

<p>Think about everything we have and interact with that measures failure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance Reviews</li>
  <li>Report Cards</li>
  <li>Credit Reports</li>
  <li>Insurance Rates</li>
  <li>Incarceration</li>
  <li>Counseling
I bet you’d love to shoot back at me with a million reason why each one of those don’t actually measure failure, and I’d be interested to hear what you have to say. I was going to originally break down each one of these things but I really don’t think it’s necessary. I made the list to prove a point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our lives rotate around not failing, and failing is how we learn. We complete a task or an action and don’t do well at it, so we figure out what we did wrong and continue. We shouldn’t dwell on the idea that a particular thing takes time to master and in the meantime, we’re sub-par. No one is a master of anything overnight. No one is a master of anything even over two nights.</p>

<p>The next time you tell yourself: “I wish I could just do today over,” let me know so I can slap you. You can go ahead and be a little bitch about it or you can just keep moving. You of all people should care the least if you haven’t mastered the day. Continue doing you and don’t worry about the rest. If you’re learning a new language, just keep working on it. If you’re trying to get into graduate school, just keep applying. If you’re developing a new app and don’t feel like it’ll meet everyone’s standards and would rather play video games because at least there you don’t get to see utter failure in the form of bad reviews, I’m sorry to say it but you need to nut up.</p>

<p>The best things you have in life are the ones you worked the hardest for. You’ll value them the most and you’ll appreciate having them around. This goes for people, too.</p>

<p>The next time you tell yourself you failed, tell yourself instead that you’ll be better at it tomorrow. Yoda tells us there is no “try.” That cat was right.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page14/" rel="bookmark" title="Using Words">Using Words</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-03-06T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>One thing I’ve always struggled with just a bit is my ability to translate my thoughts into words. When I write them down, I typically don’t have a problem. When it comes to speaking them, that’s where I falter from time to time.</p>

<p>There are times when I’ve been sitting in interviews and feel myself slipping into utter destruction and the only way to pull myself out was to craft some kind of visual aid. If I’m in a meeting room with a whiteboard, I’ll definitely take advantage of that because when I can draw out or otherwise illustrate what I’m trying to convey, I have a much better time actually saying it. A couple years ago, I had a technical interview that I would have otherwise failed if I hadn’t be able to illustrate the processes I was trying to describe that I was making up in my head as I went along.</p>

<p>Some people are really good with speaking. I’m not one of those people. What I want to say and what actually comes out are two different things.</p>

<p>Don’t even get me started on trying to start a presentation or other conversation where a lot of people are intently listening to me and waiting for words to come out of my mouth.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I had a to write a lengthly technical description of something, I’d bust it out in no time. As I’m writing this in fact, I’m not even looking at my screen, but instead outside the bus window at the traffic passing by.</p>

<p>Interviews have always been a struggle for me because there are so many things I want to say but being able to organize them as they come out verbally is something I’m not quite sure how to fix. When I’m interviewing with someone, I try to make it clear that my strength in explaining things lies with my words on paper (digital or otherwise). I can write directions for anything in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>There’s one key that makes this so easy for me: I can go back and review it.</p>

<p>I try not to edit my words as much as possible. Whatever I put down is typically the truth, even if it sounds shitty or a bit off. And when I say the truth, I mean the unfiltered thought. I don’t typically go back and censor what I’m saying either. I don’t have time nor do I actually care to. All I want to do is tell the world what I’m thinking.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if I should write technical documents for a living. Become a technical writer. I’m sure I’d do pretty well at that. I write a lot of documentation for the team I work on and manage on a regular basis. I’ve single-handedly created processes that people now blindly follow without a second guess because they believe that what I’m saying is true and is right. No one questions the directions I give them if I give them said directions written out.</p>

<p>Sometimes I get funny looks if I tell them how to do something verbally, though, and I totally understand.</p>

<p>As I reflect on situations like that, I realize I get ahead of myself in the process as I work through it in my head. Once I speak the words of event think about them, I’m already onto the next step. As I write, I can’t do that. I’m focused on placing one sentence at a time onto the digital or physical paper and don’t move on until I’m done.</p>

<p>Some would describe that as a very small sign of a mental disorder. I’m sure at least one person would say it’s OCD-like. Some would probably ponder a slight autistic quality about it.</p>

<p>Who knows. I might have any of those things. I know my younger brother is autistic. He’s terrible when it comes to interactions but that kid is damn smart. Growing up, he took to video games like flies and dog crap. He’s five years and change younger than me but he schooled me in just about any video game we played once he got the hang of the mechanics.</p>

<p>Once I got the hang of the mechanics involved in writing, I did the same thing.</p>

<p>I’m not super social, and I’m all right with that. I can spend all weekend in front of my computer writing about stuff and discussing topics with people I never see and not have a care in the world. I could also spend al weekend on the beach with my camera taking photos without speaking a word to anyone.</p>

<p>I bet if I was to do some more research on the autism spectrum, I’d probably find some qualities that I happen to possess. I’m sure we all do in some form or another, but that doesn’t make us autistic. The spectrum has become really wide and we put more and more people in it because of vaccines we don’t know how to classify them any other way.</p>

<p>I’m sure if a doctor told me I was slightly autistic, I wouldn’t care. I wouldn’t feel any different. It would explain my tendencies, but they’re mild enough that with enough effort from other angles, can be suppressed. Most days I just choose not to suppress them.</p>

<p>Take now, for example. Most days I’d be napping on the bus on my way to work because why not? Today, I decided to pack my laptop and continue writing. I didn’t get enough time this morning to write and I really enjoy it. A lot of people are sitting around me with their eyes closed, probably thinking about nothing. I’m sitting here bettering myself through words. I call that a big win.</p>

<p>Now that this paragraph puts me at a thousand and four words for a rather simple topic, I want to close with this one thought: as a society we try to make everything black and white; I’m super guilty of this. We’re not black and white creatures, though. There are literally an infinite number of facets to each and every one of us.</p>

<p>Don’t put someone down because of their inability to do something particularly well. I’d bet you ten bucks in whatever currency you use that there’s a variant of that skill they’re really good at. In my case, I’d hate to speak publicly because I’m not that good at improvising. I could write a speech for someone in no time at all and master the hell out of it.</p>

<p>We’re all incredibly different. Remember that.</p>

    <p>When I heard the news today that the long awaited Office for Mac update was close at hand and a preview was available, I was pretty excited.</p>

<p>Downloading the installer was painless. At 3GB, it’s hefty. On install, it takes more space than that, at 5.6GB, but not more than I would expect. Don’t let the installer fool you, though. Even if you only have just that amount of space, it won’t let you continue unless you’re at least 2x over that.</p>

<p>The installer took about five minutes to run, and I was in business. I can’t say I’ve been able to install Office on a Windows machine in five minutes, that’s for sure.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-word">Microsoft Word</h2>
<p>I fired up Word first, as that’s a program I use a lot. I put Word 2011 and 2016 side by side to get a view of what it used to look like and what it looks like now.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0519.07.511.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>I grabbed APA paper templates from their respective start screens to use as demonstration documents. The templates aren’t the same (the 2016 templates are easier to search through) but you get the idea. Right form the get go, I’m already enjoying the new UI and its color scheme for 2016. I don’t appreciate the fact that 100% makes the document super small on my screen, but I suspect that’s the product of my screen resolution compared to its size. It’ll be another case where I zoom to 200% to get the screen usage I want.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0604.57.101.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Beyond that, the ribbon area is largely the same as it is in Word 2013, and as someone that uses Word 2013 a lot on a regular basis for work, this pleases me.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ribbons1.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using word was as smooth as I would expect it to be. Even the default font that appears in Office for Windows looks good on a Mac. I mean really good. Sometimes I wonder what the heck is going on in Windows when it comes to fonts.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.05.161.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="microsoft-excel">Microsoft Excel</h3>
<p>When I started Excel, the first thing that jumped out at me was the new start window. It’s simple, and I like simple. Not much else to say there. Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all have this same opening screen to start you off on.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.07.111.png?resize=860%2C558" alt="" /></p>

<p>Working with spreadsheets is as typical of work as it gets in Excel and you either like doing them or you don’t. I use excel a lot at work, too, and 2016 feels very similar, which is quite nice. Everything renders just like I’d expect it to and everything is in roughly the same place.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.08.201.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>I won’t go into the same level of detail as I did with Word. I don’t feel like there’s a need to repeat myself.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-powerpoint">Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
<p>Ahh, the Keynote competitor. If you’re running a Mac on a daily basis, you’re familiar with Keynote, for sure. PowerPoint is the presentation god in a Windows-based business environment and I’m sure Microsoft wouldn’t mind sucking up a good user base in the OS X environment, too.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-0605.12.481.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here I am saying it again with PowerPoint: the interface is very similar to its Windows counterpart. Now that I’ve said that for the third time, I’m sure you’re tired of hearing it.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-outlook">Microsoft Outlook</h2>
<p>Outlook is one of those email apps that if you need it, you absolutely can’t live without it. of these apps, this was the only one that needed time to prepare. I was running the earlier preview of Outlook and because of that it needed to upgrade its database.</p>

<p>I can’t really show you what I see in Outlook as I have work emails in it and I really don’t want to share that stuff. Here’s an image from Microsoft, instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Office-2016-for-Mac-5-1024x600.jpg?resize=882%2C517" alt="" /></p>

<p>While trying to clean up my email accounts in Outlook, it ended up freezing, which is definitely not good. I had the same issues with it before the whole 2016 suite preview was released so there’s still some work that needs to be done.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-onenote">Microsoft OneNote</h2>
<p>OneNote is Microsoft’s answer to Evernote and the like. Unfortunately it’s not a good enough answer. While it doesn’t cost extra money to use Onenote, you can’t really get all the features you can with Evernote. Document conversion and searchable PDFs are a pipe dream for sure and even though things like that cost money with Evernote, it’s a small price and well worth the effort. OneNote syncs with OneDrive which is great if you enjoy OneDrive. Otherwise, you’re out of luck when it comes to storing your notebooks. I suppose Evernote stores your stuff in its cloud storage area, too, which isn’t much different.</p>

<p>OneNote was also quite slow to start, too. If you’re an Evernote fan, I suggest you stick with it for now. There’s nothing in OneNote that would make we want to switch over.</p>

<h2 id="the-cloud">The Cloud</h2>
<p>Everything is in the cloud now, whether we like it or not. Each of these apps no longer require a serial number to activate, but instead just an active Office 365 subscription. I know what you’re thinking, you don’t like the idea of paying ‘membership fee’ or an ‘access fee’ to use your Office. What that sounds like to me is you not understanding how software EULAs work. Software is never really yours to begin with, you are just granted access to it. In this particular case, access is granted on a month-to-month basis, and is cheaper overall than paying outright. Office for Mac 2011 is $139. A single Office 365 license is $60 a year and comes with OneDrive storage out your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. This subscription model’s savings is realized even more when you find out you can use the Windows version, too, for no extra charge. Office 2013 costs upwards of $400 retail. Doesn’t sound like too bad of an offer, now does it?</p>

<p>If you’re a student, you’re automatically given a free O365 license. Free office is awesome, and definitely not worth complaining over, even if it isn’t a one-time payment, anymore.</p>

<p>Keep in mind you can purchase a subscription up front for a year, too, if you still really want to hold on to some semblance of the old days.</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>I’m sure you’ve realized that Microsoft’s choice to make the UIs as similar as possible was intentional. Cross-platform support is a real thing now at Microsoft and Office for Mac isn’t just some side project somewhere. OS X and iOS are real platforms in their eyes now and the updates reflect that.</p>

<p>I’m sure Microsoft appreciates your feedback. On the top right corner of every app is a smiley. Click on that bad boy and send them your feedback about the application you’re using. If you’re not a fan, tell them. If you are, tell them that, too.</p>

<p>With this major shift, I suspect Office for Mac will receive more regular updates that don’t take five years to cultivate. Microsoft’s Office for Mac team needed a huge culture shift and they received it under the transition from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella. Apple platforms aren’t a joke, anymore.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-03-06T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</time>
    <p>I came across <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com">this site and program</a> yesterday, a coding camp for girls. While I’m not a girl, I feel like I can still appreciate the idea of such a thing. If I had daughters, I’d want them to give this a shot. As much as we don’t want to admit it, girls aren’t all about ponies and princesses. It’s about creating better ponies and princesses through agile development practices. LOL.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I’ve made a joke about an actual program that does good work, <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com">App Camp for Girls</a> is something I could get behind. We don’t have enough girls and women in STEM fields in the educational world nor in the professional world. Personally, I want to see more women as software developers.</p>

<p>Of course this would imply that the frat house environment that a lot of startups end up having because they’re 90% dude would have to end. You might be a startup, but you need to grow up. Don’t tell me that’s just how startups are… that’s deflection. </p>

<p>I don’t doubt there’s still an issue surrounding the equality of men and women in society. Look at gamer gate: a bunch of probably gross nerds sitting in their parent’s basements railing on women because they’re women and misogyny runs rampant in their lonely lives. </p>

<p>I’m excited to see where <a href="http://appcamp4girls.com">App Camp for Girls</a> expands to. They’re already rocking the North West with events in Vancouver, BC, Seattle WA, Portland, OR, and even Central NJ (which is definitely not in the NW).</p>

    <p>Last night while I was browsing <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, I came across a rather exhaustive list of free things startups can use in one capacity or another. <a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-startups-and-entrepreneurship/300-awesome-free-things-e07b3cd5fd5b">300 Awesome Free Things</a> covers everything and ended up become its own website: <a href="http://freebie.supply">Freebie.Supply</a>.</p>

<p>Freebie.Supply covered Business, Marketing, Design/Code, Productivity, and Learning tools that are essentially 100% free. It’s really quite a great resource to poke through and see what you can take advantage of right now, without having to put out a single penny.</p>

<p>That’s all I have for right now. A busy day is ahead of me. Keep up the good fight and continue working on whatever you’re doing to improve your quality of life.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page14/" rel="bookmark" title="Recovering From Failure, Part 2">Recovering From Failure, Part 2</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-03-04T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">04 Mar 2015</time>
    <p><a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/failure" title="Recovering from Failure">Yesterday</a>, I spent a few minutes spilling my guts about a recent failure. It felt good to get it out there and the support and helpful words I received made it feel less painful. Failing sucks and it’s hard to swallow the truth that you’ll fail at something you think you’re good at.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve had a little bit of time to look back on it, I see it in a more neutral light. While I’m certainly still bummed out, it’s not affecting me like it did yesterday and the day before. Truth be told, I’m just one of many. My story isn’t unique or groundbreaking. Even the smartest of people fail at things from time to time. It’s what they do afterwards that makes a difference.</p>

<p>This failure event was timed perfectly. After listening to <a href="http://john.do">John Saddington</a>’s first podcast show thing called <a href="http://blog.desk.pm/ati-001/">Ask The Indie</a>, it got me thinking. What am I doing to continually enrich myself, not just in my regular studies but in my career? I want to be in a better position in five years, a year, even six months from now, doing more of what I enjoy: making things that people see.</p>

<p>(Aside: part of the reason why I chose a self-hosted option for running this site, based on <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I could used a hosted platform and I would probably enjoy it, but that’s not what I’m about.)</p>

<p>I made a decision last Friday that every weekday, I would spend one hour doing something that enriched my technical knowledge bucket in my head and can be used to further my career (when combined with other essential pieces). This is where the site <a href="http://trueability.com">TrueAbility</a> comes into play. I’ve known about them for some time but always looked at them like they were just a performance/technical assessment type site for job hunters. While that’s certainly true, there’s more to their offerings.</p>

<p>One of the cool things they offer are a lot of “101” courses on technical matters, typically surrounding development, Linux, WordPress, and other SysAdmin-y type things. They’re free to use and if you’re looking for a job, they have listings, too. Take one of their performance tests with questions chosen by the employer and they’ll send your results straight to them and likely put you on a shortlist compared to taking the traditional route of submitting a resume.</p>

<p>I really enjoy their platform and how quickly one can get started. The catch is everything is done via the command line so get comfortable with SSH/Putty, Linux, and other non-Windows development processes. Did I mention the tests are timed? I didn’t? Oh, well they’re timed. Most are 60-90 minutes in length. If you’re taking a performance assessment created by a potential employer, it would behoove you to not get hung up on one thing you can’t figure out. If you spend all your time on one problem and never move on to the rest, it’ll bring your score down. Each question is not all or nothing in most cases so come back to it and complete some of the other tasks, instead. It’ll make a big difference, I promise. Getting an 80% is much better than getting a 20% because you spent all your time on the first of five tasks.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, the real trick is to never give up and to never stop pushing forward. The proverbial horse will always be there to get back up on, that apple cart isn’t going to leave without you, and take advantage of <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/settling">your support system</a> if you have one. It’ll help immensely. <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support" title="My Support">It’s helping me</a>, quite a bit.</p>

<p>In other news, I received contact for an interview with another company, yesterday, so that also did quite a bit to boost my spirits. In my case, there’ll be all “no” responses until I get a yes. That’s just how it is.</p>

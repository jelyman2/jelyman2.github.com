    <p>TAKE IT FROM ME.</p>

<p>It’s easy to give advice. It’s actually way too easy. Standing on the outside, looking in, it’s easy to observe, to judge. We compare someone and the pieces that make them whole to ourselves and our own components.</p>

<p>One thing we fail to do all too often is heed our own advice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do as I say, not as I do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those words were likely spoken by every parent to ever exist even so far as millennia past. We secretly swear but tell our children that such acts are bad. We teach that good [religious group] should regularly [reglion-based activity] but we fail to even keep par with the course.</p>

<p>I can sit here in front of my screen and bang on the keyboard in an attempt to preach to you about how you should <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/life-changes/">create better habits</a> and how you should do that extra good thing every day and how you should <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/naturebox/">stop shoveling shit</a> for food into your grub hole every day.</p>

<p>I’d be a damn hypocrite if I did that. There’s a fine line between sharing good ideas and things that sound like they’d be worthwhile and preaching them as gospel and it’s hard to see when initially observed.</p>

<p>Take it from me. There are times when I want to tell the world how awesome it is to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half/">get up early</a> in the morning, sit down, and kick some creative ass, all before breakfast, except I can’t manage to do that, myself, right now. So I don’t. I use to. I used to tout how awesome it was, regularly.</p>

<p>Back then, though, I did it. Every single day. I woke up between 3:30 and 4:00 A.M., hopped in the shower, made coffee, and sat down with enough time for almost an hour of un-interrupted creativity and morning reflection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>take care of your own yard before you start criticizing your neighbor’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I refuse to tout what I don’t follow or believe, myself. I think it’s important to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/on-accepting/">nut up or shut up</a>. I know <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/">struggling</a> with <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/">inspiration</a> is real. I’ve discovered <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/">creativity</a> comes to those who <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/">hunt it down</a> like a rabid wolf hunts a juicy deer. I know what it’s like to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/">have your mind</a> in the <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/">wrong place</a>.</p>

<p>Most of all, I know <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/incapacity/">making excuses</a> is for the weak. The <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/professional-life-liver/">professional</a> doesn’t <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/magic/">make an excuse</a>. Take it from me.</p>

    <p>There’s a perpetual battle that takes place every day. This battle involves everything around you, your life, your hobbies, your friends, and your home.</p>

<p>This battle isn’t really a battle at all. It’s a dance. A tango, of sorts. We wake up in the morning and it’s time to dance. We lay our heads down at night and only after we close our eyes and drift into dreamland do we stop the motions.</p>

<p>From those words, it should be at least a step down from completely confusing what I’m referring to. If you’re not a mind-reader, or you haven’t skipped ahead, I don’t hold it against you.</p>

<p>What I’m talking about is satisfaction… being content with the things you have… the people you know… the amount of money you make.</p>

<p>Let me get this out there right now before I continue: I’m not saying you shouldn’t push for that raise or buy a new car to replace your current mode of transportation or anything of the sort. What I’m talking about is knowing when to gun for greatness and when to sit and be satisfied.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a story.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, a lot in my life has changed. The biggest change in my life was when I got married. My wife has been and will always be the biggest blessing to me. Beside her, there’ve been a host of other life changes (also known as obstacles) and there have been improvements.</p>

<p>Every so often, we move. This has been the case, historically, since 2011. So far as I can count, in the last four years, we’ve lived in five apartments of our own and one belonging to friends, including the one we live in, now. Each move has led us to a progressively better living situation, for the most part.</p>

<p>But there are times when we’ve taken lateral steps and most currently, we took a half-step backward.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about downgrading to living with other people or on the street or having to move back home. We picked a less-than-ideal neighborhood.</p>

<p>We had good reason, however. It was April, myy wife was slated to start graduate school at the end of the summer, our existing lease was set to end at the end of May, and I received a job offer that required us to move sooner rather than later, with later being the end of May.</p>

<p>We only had a few weeks to find a place to live. The money wasn’t unlimited so we couldn’t take our sweet time. Based on information we found online (apartment hunting), we found a place that looked decent. We had no idea what the neighborhood would be like because we had never been there before and were pretty new to the Bay Area in general. Our last visit was almost an indirect one as we played tourists and visited Golden Gate Park.</p>

<p>After we move in, we come to find that perhaps our decision was a bit rushed, but it was too late to do anything about it, now. We were already there. We spent two days moving 900 miles and couldn’t return home. We also couldn’t shore up somewhere until we figured out a better living situation. We discovered our neighborhood wasn’t the best, as some would call Hayward, CA <em>Little Mexico</em>. Maybe they were right. I, for one, love Mexican food, so there’s no harm in that.</p>

<p>However it’s not the safest area, either. I’ll admit that the large gates and high walls around our apartment building signify more than just styling choices.</p>

<p>We have a little crime-free oasis. While it might not be ideal, it’s working out for us, right now, and we’re OK with that.</p>

<p>After all that, it all comes down to accepting what we have and learning to cope. Sure, we could move out, and we probably will at some point, but until that time comes, there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s time to suck it up and deal with our choices.</p>

<p>Do I regret the decision to move to the East Bay? No. Do I regret any of the decisions I’ve made in recent history? Absolutely not. Why? Because I’ve accepted them. I accepted the fact that I defaulted on a credit card one time, or I spent too much money on something I didn’t need. Fuck it. Life happens.</p>

<p>We all make mistakes and decide to travel the less than ideal path. However, when we’re faced with two decisions were neither are perfect, we suck it up and pick one. It’s the whole life-giving-you-lemons thing. We have a ton of lemonade to go around.</p>

<p>Don’t take my story as me saying I just gave up and decided that complacency is the best path to choose. That’s not at all the case. The path I code is one of more careful planning, better allocation of resources and making more informed decisions. I’m choosing to do take the slow road so I can spend the time to do it right.</p>

<p>So when it comes to making a life-changing decision, do you jump down off the roof onto the ground head first or feet first?</p>

        48 Hours of Slack
      </a>
    </h1>
    <time datetime="2015-06-25T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</time>
    <p>Two nights ago, I convinced my team to pick up Slack. I wanted them to stop slacking on effective communication and while I can cut them some slack on being in different time zones, there’s no excuse with today’s technology.</p>

<p>That’s about all I have for Slack puns and euphemisms. We’ve been using Slack for about 48 hours now and we’re loving it. I think I might be loving it the most because I championed the idea.</p>

<p>Given its super low barrier for entry (free!) it wasn’t hard for us to pick it up and give it a go. My team is only twelve people but I think we’ve communicated more via text than we’ve communicated via Lync and email in a week.</p>

<p>I described it in our meeting as IRC for this decade, but it’s a lot more than that and I’m striving to find ways to expand the service for my people as much as possible.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, I’m the Senior Technical Support Lead for Zephyr’s Americas support team. That puts me at second in command and makes me responsible for my teams success. One struggle I’ve seen is keeping effective lines of communication open between each staff member and creating open dialog about technical and customer-facing issues we encounter on a regular basis.</p>

<p>We really didn’t have any sort of real-time collaboration going on.</p>

<p>This is why I brought in Slack. I can see who’s available, strike up conversations with them, discuss particular issues in channels, and get notified from various other systems right away, without having to leave Slack.</p>

<p>I’ve found out about support requests faster through Slack than by staring at ZenDesk all day (our ticketing system). Getting notifications on all my devices at the same time about what’s happening as its happening is a boon for me and that only drives my desire to integrate more.</p>

<p>One thing that bothers me though is autocomplete requires some fancy service on the other end in order to work. I don’t want to sit down and write middleware to tie into Slack so I can shorthand with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">/slash</code> command. I should be able to say <code class="highlighter-rouge">/ticket 12345</code> prints in chat <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://ticket.system/12345</code>. I don’t see what’s so hard about that.</p>

<p>Webhooks are super cool though and being able to touch them with 3rd party service and update my channels with relevant information is awesome. Being able to be notified in real time about anything that’s happening in another system with minimal code change is sweet. All our custom apps can push notifications, now.</p>

<p>Even well-known 3rd party services can integrate well. Some leave things to be desired like my ZenDesk-Slack integration, but I can’t blame Slack for that.</p>

<p>For a service that’s had next to no marketing done and has survived on majority word of mouth and small advertisements here and there, Slack is killing it in the real-time collaboration space.</p>

<p>Someone on my team suggested we look at HipChat, too… is it bad that I sort of don’t want to?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Finding inspiration is hard, which is why I don’t like looking for it. To say it takes a lot of effort to figure out what to write about is to say it takes a lot of time to figure out that you want to wear something that looks good on your body, today.</p>

    <p>I’m always looking for new places to discover great services and products. Last night Crozdesk followed me on Twitter and I couldn’t help but check them out and see what they offer. Really, I check out just about anyone that follows me on twitter. I’m by no means a superstar on the social network so I have time for things like that.</p>

<p>Crozdesk is a place to find a company, service, or product offering to fulfill a need you might have in various spaces, be it web design, hosting, social media, marketing, or anything relatively similar.</p>

<p>Their offering list is small-ish but I see it growing quickly as there’s no charge for submitting your product or service to the site. If you’re an indie developer or a small startup that has something cool, this would be the place to share it and let the community rate and offer their opinion on it.</p>

    <p>I’ve been meaning to tinker with Discourse for a while, now. It’s used at several of my favorite sites for their communities so I found it reasonable to try it out for myself and see how it works out.</p>

<p>My end goal was to use it as a comment replacement.</p>

<p>Did I get there?</p>

<p>I think so…</p>

    <p>So I’m sitting here, pondering what to write about. I’ve been a terrible person, not sticking to the plan.</p>

<p>If you know me at all, you’ll know it is indeed a chaotic scene when there’s no plan and I’m involved.</p>

<p>Steven Pressfield is one of my new favorite authors and his book <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a> speaks great truths about what it takes to transition from average joe doing some crap somewhere to becoming a professional and doing what you really want to do.</p>

<p>There’s a small passage in <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a> that fits well in today’s post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twelve-step programs say: “One day at a time.” The professional says the same thing.He’s right though. I could sit here and ramble about how I can’t figure out anything to write, how my creativity is available for just a moment, and how planning out a crazy level of future posts would be fruitless and a waste of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I said all that, it would be true. Sitting here thinking about planning out content makes me tired and want to just watch HBO (which I plan on doing after I finish writing this, anyway). Planning isn’t going to bring creativity. Inspiration is just a trigger for creativity. I could sit and stare out my window at the street and get inspiration creative.</p>

<p>There’s a million ways to come up with an idea, but the best one is the one where you take it one step at a time, one day at a time.</p>

        Keeping Score

    <time datetime="2015-06-16T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">16 Jun 2015</time>
    <p>I decided to start a project for the wrong reason. It’s because of this reason that I ended up giving up said project for the short term.</p>

<p>I thought I had it all figured out. I carved out time on my calendar, I made plans, I had an idea…</p>

<p>Turns out, the measurement for success in this project was grossly incorrect, and I realized it a couple days ago when I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936891034/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936891034&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=johnatlymanco-20&amp;linkId=SQZD7GW7YIX5GIY5">Steven Pressfield’s Turning Pro</a>. I never finished the book, so I felt it was appropriate to continue.</p>

<p>I came across this passage and it really hit home surrounding this project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real utility of money is its convenience as a medium of exchange. If you and I have a goat in Smyrna, we don’t have to carry the poor beast in our arms all the way to Aleppo to trade it for a carpet. We can sell the goat in Smyrna, stash a silver dairy in our pocket, then take the dairy to Aleppo to buy the carpet.But when we’re addicted to money, we become hooked on the metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is money how we keep score? Is it magic? Is wealth a currency that opens doors, realizes possibilities, produces transcendence?</p>

<p>– Turning Pro</p>

<p>In my case… it was.</p>

<p>I thought I could craft this project and end up getting rich quick. I’ve seen enough documentaries on how that’s never the case but yet I thought otherwise. When my project started, I got a huge influx of traffic to it and I thought it was going to be smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Then the traffic died off, and everyone left. Not a sole gave a damn. I was hoping they’d throw their digital selves at me in the form of coming back or contributing, but they didn’t.</p>

<p>I wanted to make money off this project. I wanted it to become a full-time thing. I didn’t think about the other battle I was waging that would ultimately affect this one.</p>

<p>Losing sight of what’s most important in any project is common and while sometimes it’s recoverable, other times, there’s no way to go but to the bitter end.</p>

<p>I canceled my subscriptions to all the things necessary to keep it running. It’ll die in a few days, and that’s OK by me. It shouldn’t have ever lived. I wasn’t ready for it and I made a Frankenstein.</p>

<p>Such is life.</p>

<p>Learning experiences can be tough sometimes, but when you’re keeping score for all the wrong reasons, it’s bound to happen… and it should. It keeps reality in play.</p>

<p>So instead, I’m focusing on what’s most important and fulfilling for me. I need to keep my head in as few places as possible, while still getting enough stimulation to keep myself fresh and mentally alive.</p>

<p>Too many outlets can lead to burn out, even if all said outlets are appealing. Sometimes, going back to the basics is exactly what the doctor ordered.</p>

    <p>What do you think of when I say that amateurs look for excuses?</p>

<p>It’s a rhetorical question and I don’t expect an answer. Instead, that sentence should really be a statement. It’s an obvious one to someone who’s paying attention, but on the inside, it’s harder.</p>

<p>Also known as the easy way out, looking to find a way out of a tough situation by copping out or giving up is modus operandi of those who can’t hack it. Amateurs.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about people who aren’t good enough at a specific thing. No one should expect to be experts at everything they do. What I’m talking about is life. Sticking with the shit that comes your way. Dealing with less than ideal situations.</p>

<p>Whoever first said “shit happens” is the realist realist the world will ever experience. One thing a professional understands is that sometimes you step in it, but the best route is to clean it off and keep moving.</p>

<p>This idea became one I find myself gravitating towards after reading a relevant passage in <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The habits and addictions of the amateur are…self-inflicted wounds…[Amateurs] no longer have to face the real fight of our lives, which is to become who we are and to realize our destiny and our calling.That’s not some hippie shit from a guy smoking weed. That’s real talk from a guy who used to be an amateur. If you’ve ever thought about reading what it takes to rock life and kick it’s ass, he’s the guy to go to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about this: how easy is it to make an excuse? It just slips right on out there without anyone noticing… except you… time and again… uttering the same garbage… because you can’t accept the fact you failed at something… or many somethings.</p>

<p>A pro would admit wrong and rectify it. Today. Right freaking now.</p>

<p>You also don’t see pros telling their boss they didn’t have time to create that presentation that’s due today, even though all they did was sit on Reddit and bitch about their boss. An amateur is quick to make excuses for themselves to protect their mediocrity and constant state of incapacitation of potential.</p>

<p>I made a small resolution to kick ass this year, and this is one of the many ways to do it because 2015 isn’t quite over. I don’t have to relocate my foot in someone’s ass physically, to rock my goal.</p>

<p>One of the many ways it starts is by accepting the challenge that lays in front of me, every day. Each moment, there’s a hurdle, and each moment I can jump or smash into it like a lumbering blob of crap.</p>

<p>The latter doesn’t sound so appealing, does it…</p>

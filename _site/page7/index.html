    <p>I’m always on the lookout for new and interesting apps that make the desktop writing experience more enjoyable. I’m a big fan of <a href="http://desk.pm">Desk</a> and <a href="http://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> and wondered what other kinds of markdown-based writing tools were out there.</p>

<p>A quick Google search turned up more than a few and I only had time to talk about one, tonight, so I picked a free entry in the space, <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a believer of having a good-quality, distraction-free writing environment to craft stories, blog posts, news articles, and even school papers*, one of the biggest things to me is the ability to go full-on distraction-free mode and be able to just write, without anything else getting in the way. Writed does the full-screen writing mode well with several styles to choose from. Since it was night when I wrote this, I found it suitable to sit by a lamp at my desk and use the Night theme. The contrast is good and I’m not struggling to see. Plus, if I darken the brightness of my screen, the dark grey background becomes almost black, and the words still pop.</p>

<h3 id="distraction-free">99% Distraction Free</h3>
<p>A word and character counter sit at the bottom of the screen, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to make that bar disappear, so strictly speaking, I’m not operating in full distraction-free mode like my favorites would alow me to do, but we’re close. To be honest, I like to see the numbers from time to time because it feels like I’m increasing some magical word score and I’m shooting for a high score. I have this odd fascination with things that allow me to attain exceedingly high scores with no real reward at the end but an even higher score.</p>

<h3 id="basic-markdown-support">Basic Markdown Support</h3>
<p>Writed does markdown writing well with it’s backtick ( ` ) code support, as well as proper emphasis with single and double-underscore and -asterisk support. Headers and code blocks work fine, as well as blockquoting with greater-than carats ( the &gt; symbol).</p>

<p>If I was going to chang anything about this application, I’d only do one thing: make the bottom bar something I can hide. Given that it’s a slightly different color in the theme, it stands out from the rest of the editing space and is just a smidge distracting. Other than that, I like <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a> and for the price of FREE with a couple optional in-app purchases, it’s super hard to say no to such an app that gets the basic markdown-centric-distraction-limited-writing-space job done.</p>

    <p>This is something I never knew existed. The <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> team posted <a href="https://medium.com/the-story/custom-domains-for-publications-8cb161d9651">this article</a> back in March about their limited beta launch of custom domains for publications that use Medium as a publishing platform.</p>

<p>The article isn’t super detailed about the whole process and there’s only a few publications on board as of the March 12, 2015 story, but this is something I’ve been wanting to see from Medium for a long time. Their publishing platform is awesome. It’s super easy to use and is formatted very well for long-form articles and stories that feature big and beautiful imagery.</p>

<p>My only hope is that they extend this to everyone at some point in time.</p>

    <p>I published my 200th blog post for the year, just <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed">a bit ago</a>, with a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/writed">review</a> of the free markdown editing app <a href="http://writed.io">Writed</a>. It’s crazy to think that starting in <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/01/">January</a>, up until today, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/2015/07/09/">July 9th</a>, I’ve written 200 blog posts (with this one being #201).</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure what the next 200 posts will hold, but I hope to be able to get them in before the end of the year. There’s a tad less than 1/2 of the calendar year to go so I’m looking at quite a challenge, but I was able to start strong in the beginning of the year so there’s no excuse why I can’t sit down and bust out 200 different things I want to talk about.</p>

<p>I have a lot on my mind.</p>

    <p>I never thought I’d end up being a fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise. I haven’t so much as played any of the past titles including the ever popular Skyrim.</p>

<p>Then last weekend, while I was scrolling through the PlayStation Store on my PlayStation 4, I came across Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited. I was naturally a bit curious as I hadn’t followed the franchise much and wanted to know more about this unknown-to-me installment.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it wasn’t a new installment at all so much as it was an all-access pass to the Elder Scrolls Online world. Previously, people had to pay monthly for the game like those who play World of Warcraft and MMOs like it. Having a one-time fee of $60 seemed much more appealing to someone like me that might pick it up and put it down here and there and go a significant while without playing.</p>

<p>The last thing I wanted to do at this point in my gaming career (if you can call it that) was to end up spending $15-20 a month on a game that I only play for a few hours a week. The total cost of ownership would be much lower at this single price point, even at the same duration of play per month.</p>

<p>So I caved and bought it. Since it was a digital purchase, I more or less bought rights to play it, but that’s just semantics. I really thought I would be able to pick it up and start playing that same night. As it turns out, that wasn’t quite the case.</p>

<p>At almost 36GB for the main game and 18GB for the “update” to said game, I was in for a wait. A 55GB game is nothing to sneeze and and that gave me hope there would be a lot of content and a lot of places to explore.</p>

<p>The next day, long after it downloaded, I fired it up and jumped into the fray. This comes after spending a few hours the night before watching YouTube videos to partly learn about what’s going on and partly secretly justify my (probably) non-refundable purchase.</p>

<p>First impressions are important, and I wasn’t really disappointed. The visuals are on par with what I would expect from a current-generation game console at steady frame rates. The story is as fantasy as it can get. The interface took some getting used to as this is my first foray into the console-MMO space. Quest markers were the hardest parts to get down.</p>

<p>After several hours, I was hooked, however, and am glad I made the purchase. So far, I’ve sunk roughly 10 hours into the game and have just scratched the surface. I look forward to continuing my digital adventures with my character named NathanielIronbow. Cheesy, I know.</p>

    <p>I’m not sure why I didn’t discover this earlier. My excitement when Spotify came to the PlayStation 4 was moderate and I’ve been using Spotify as an all-but-replacement for my rotting Apple iTunes (now Apple Music) library for some time.</p>

<p>One thing I never put together until today is that I can control what’s playing on my PlayStation 4 via Spotify on my Mac.</p>

<p>I’m sure this isn’t news to a lot of people, but it is to me, so you know what…?</p>

<p>…mind blown.</p>

    <p><a href="http://stackedit.io">StackEdit</a> is a in-browser markdown editor that takes on the likes of iA Writer and GitHub Pages in terms of its capability. If you’re a fan of Markdown in even the least bit, it’ll be easy for StackEdit to be your go to text editor.</p>

<p>The interface window features the basic text editor and styling controls like text format, linking, inserting code and images, and creating lists. In fact, it’s so easy to pick up, you really don’t need any instructions.</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-30-15.57.20.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-30-15.57.20.png?resize=882%2C559" alt="Screenshot 2015-06-30 15.57.20" /></a></p>

<p>The dual pane editor/preview layout is like that of the NodeJS-powered Ghost blog platform. Everything you type shows up in real time on the right-hand side of the screen in proper format. When you’re done, you can sync your texts to Dropbox or Google Drive, save them in the editor, and even push them to various end points including Blogger, WordPress, GitHub, Tumblr, and an SSH server if you have your own static site platform you wish to use.</p>

<p>What’s really cool? If you have a CouchDB instance, it’ll push straight to it. Pretty nifty.</p>

<p>Give <a href="http://stackedit.io">StackEdit</a> a try. I think you’ll like it.</p>

    <p>I have only recently started tinkering with Docker when I made a brief attempt at getting Discourse running on my server. What started out as me being quite frustrated with my lack of SMTP knowledge ended in my admittance that a pre-packaged setup would be much easier, and indeed it was.</p>

<p>Docker is good for that. Docker’s purpose is to allow swift and efficient deployment and management of applications that reside in their own containers. Think of a cargo ship. Each one of those containers can be its own app that runs exclusively in its own box/bubble/container/virtual world and on the outside Docker and the system it runs on maintains structural integrity so each container can keep running.</p>

<p>If you’re relatively new to Docker like I am, you’ll probably be wondering how easy it is to get started.</p>

<p>There are two routes: the command line route and the GUI route. Today I’m going to show off the GUI route by way of an app called Kitematic.</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-27-16.02.42.png"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-27-16.02.42.png?resize=882%2C570" alt="Screenshot 2015-06-27 16.02.42" /></a></p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of Kitematic, in my opinion, is to bridge the gap that’s created by the learning curve created by not being fully aware of how to interact with Docker on the command line.</p>

<p>Deploying an image is dirt simple. The UI presents you with a searchable area in which you can comb the Docker Hub. One click is all it takes to create an instance of the application you’re looking to install.</p>

<p>The actual deployment time will depend on your Internet connection speed because the image has to be downloaded. The larger the application, the longer it’ll take to deploy, install, and configure, so keep that in mind.</p>

<h3 id="deployment-tests">Deployment Tests</h3>
<p>Here are a few examples of apps I downloaded and how long they took from the moment I clicked the Create button to the moment they were ready to go. These incredibly non-scientific numbers come from my 2011 Macbook Pro with a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB of RAM, and the images being stored and run on an SSD. I also used the most popular choices for each of these images, including recommended ones if they were available. Each of the image were downloaded on a 125mbps Internet connection and the timing below includes that.</p>

<p>If you plan on running Kitematic a lot, you’ll want to make sure you can reserve at least 2GB of RAM for the VirtualBox VM it runs in the background. Also, check Kitematic’s settings and check the box to clean up the VM on closure if you’re on a battery-powered system. It’ll take a bit of extra time on boot but it’ll save your battery when you’re not using it, for sure.</p>

<p>I do believe it’s prudent to point out that if you choose the delete-on-closure option, you might find yourself with a VM that can’t fetch an IP address when you re-start Kitematic. This was the case 100% of the time I restarted Kitematic after killing VirtualBox on Kitematic’s closure.</p>

<h3 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>So here’s where I tell you if it’s worth it. In short, completely. For people like me that just want to get things done and move on with my day and not have to deal with the command line all the time, this is a boon. If you’re a die-hard command line junkie that thrives on typos and mashing away at the keyboard, go do it the regular, old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Kitematic is free to use and is in Beta. It might be a bit rough around the edges, and may not work very well on Windows. I tried running the JIRA install on Windows and it failed every time.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to break into Docker and the idea of containered apps, this is your vice.</p>

    <p>TAKE IT FROM ME.</p>

<p>It’s easy to give advice. It’s actually way too easy. Standing on the outside, looking in, it’s easy to observe, to judge. We compare someone and the pieces that make them whole to ourselves and our own components.</p>

<p>One thing we fail to do all too often is heed our own advice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do as I say, not as I do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those words were likely spoken by every parent to ever exist even so far as millennia past. We secretly swear but tell our children that such acts are bad. We teach that good [religious group] should regularly [reglion-based activity] but we fail to even keep par with the course.</p>

<p>I can sit here in front of my screen and bang on the keyboard in an attempt to preach to you about how you should <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/life-changes/">create better habits</a> and how you should do that extra good thing every day and how you should <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/naturebox/">stop shoveling shit</a> for food into your grub hole every day.</p>

<p>I’d be a damn hypocrite if I did that. There’s a fine line between sharing good ideas and things that sound like they’d be worthwhile and preaching them as gospel and it’s hard to see when initially observed.</p>

<p>Take it from me. There are times when I want to tell the world how awesome it is to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half/">get up early</a> in the morning, sit down, and kick some creative ass, all before breakfast, except I can’t manage to do that, myself, right now. So I don’t. I use to. I used to tout how awesome it was, regularly.</p>

<p>Back then, though, I did it. Every single day. I woke up between 3:30 and 4:00 A.M., hopped in the shower, made coffee, and sat down with enough time for almost an hour of un-interrupted creativity and morning reflection.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>take care of your own yard before you start criticizing your neighbor’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I refuse to tout what I don’t follow or believe, myself. I think it’s important to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/on-accepting/">nut up or shut up</a>. I know <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/">struggling</a> with <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/waiting-for-inspiration/">inspiration</a> is real. I’ve discovered <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/">creativity</a> comes to those who <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/creativity-2/">hunt it down</a> like a rabid wolf hunts a juicy deer. I know what it’s like to <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/">have your mind</a> in the <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/keeping-score/">wrong place</a>.</p>

<p>Most of all, I know <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/incapacity/">making excuses</a> is for the weak. The <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/professional-life-liver/">professional</a> doesn’t <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/magic/">make an excuse</a>. Take it from me.</p>

    <p>There’s a perpetual battle that takes place every day. This battle involves everything around you, your life, your hobbies, your friends, and your home.</p>

<p>This battle isn’t really a battle at all. It’s a dance. A tango, of sorts. We wake up in the morning and it’s time to dance. We lay our heads down at night and only after we close our eyes and drift into dreamland do we stop the motions.</p>

<p>From those words, it should be at least a step down from completely confusing what I’m referring to. If you’re not a mind-reader, or you haven’t skipped ahead, I don’t hold it against you.</p>

<p>What I’m talking about is satisfaction… being content with the things you have… the people you know… the amount of money you make.</p>

<p>Let me get this out there right now before I continue: I’m not saying you shouldn’t push for that raise or buy a new car to replace your current mode of transportation or anything of the sort. What I’m talking about is knowing when to gun for greatness and when to sit and be satisfied.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a story.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, a lot in my life has changed. The biggest change in my life was when I got married. My wife has been and will always be the biggest blessing to me. Beside her, there’ve been a host of other life changes (also known as obstacles) and there have been improvements.</p>

<p>Every so often, we move. This has been the case, historically, since 2011. So far as I can count, in the last four years, we’ve lived in five apartments of our own and one belonging to friends, including the one we live in, now. Each move has led us to a progressively better living situation, for the most part.</p>

<p>But there are times when we’ve taken lateral steps and most currently, we took a half-step backward.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about downgrading to living with other people or on the street or having to move back home. We picked a less-than-ideal neighborhood.</p>

<p>We had good reason, however. It was April, myy wife was slated to start graduate school at the end of the summer, our existing lease was set to end at the end of May, and I received a job offer that required us to move sooner rather than later, with later being the end of May.</p>

<p>We only had a few weeks to find a place to live. The money wasn’t unlimited so we couldn’t take our sweet time. Based on information we found online (apartment hunting), we found a place that looked decent. We had no idea what the neighborhood would be like because we had never been there before and were pretty new to the Bay Area in general. Our last visit was almost an indirect one as we played tourists and visited Golden Gate Park.</p>

<p>After we move in, we come to find that perhaps our decision was a bit rushed, but it was too late to do anything about it, now. We were already there. We spent two days moving 900 miles and couldn’t return home. We also couldn’t shore up somewhere until we figured out a better living situation. We discovered our neighborhood wasn’t the best, as some would call Hayward, CA <em>Little Mexico</em>. Maybe they were right. I, for one, love Mexican food, so there’s no harm in that.</p>

<p>However it’s not the safest area, either. I’ll admit that the large gates and high walls around our apartment building signify more than just styling choices.</p>

<p>We have a little crime-free oasis. While it might not be ideal, it’s working out for us, right now, and we’re OK with that.</p>

<p>After all that, it all comes down to accepting what we have and learning to cope. Sure, we could move out, and we probably will at some point, but until that time comes, there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s time to suck it up and deal with our choices.</p>

<p>Do I regret the decision to move to the East Bay? No. Do I regret any of the decisions I’ve made in recent history? Absolutely not. Why? Because I’ve accepted them. I accepted the fact that I defaulted on a credit card one time, or I spent too much money on something I didn’t need. Fuck it. Life happens.</p>

<p>We all make mistakes and decide to travel the less than ideal path. However, when we’re faced with two decisions were neither are perfect, we suck it up and pick one. It’s the whole life-giving-you-lemons thing. We have a ton of lemonade to go around.</p>

<p>Don’t take my story as me saying I just gave up and decided that complacency is the best path to choose. That’s not at all the case. The path I code is one of more careful planning, better allocation of resources and making more informed decisions. I’m choosing to do take the slow road so I can spend the time to do it right.</p>

<p>So when it comes to making a life-changing decision, do you jump down off the roof onto the ground head first or feet first?</p>

    <p>Two nights ago, I convinced my team to pick up Slack. I wanted them to stop slacking on effective communication and while I can cut them some slack on being in different time zones, there’s no excuse with today’s technology.</p>

<p>That’s about all I have for Slack puns and euphemisms. We’ve been using Slack for about 48 hours now and we’re loving it. I think I might be loving it the most because I championed the idea.</p>

<p>Given its super low barrier for entry (free!) it wasn’t hard for us to pick it up and give it a go. My team is only twelve people but I think we’ve communicated more via text than we’ve communicated via Lync and email in a week.</p>

<p>I described it in our meeting as IRC for this decade, but it’s a lot more than that and I’m striving to find ways to expand the service for my people as much as possible.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, I’m the Senior Technical Support Lead for Zephyr’s Americas support team. That puts me at second in command and makes me responsible for my teams success. One struggle I’ve seen is keeping effective lines of communication open between each staff member and creating open dialog about technical and customer-facing issues we encounter on a regular basis.</p>

<p>We really didn’t have any sort of real-time collaboration going on.</p>

<p>This is why I brought in Slack. I can see who’s available, strike up conversations with them, discuss particular issues in channels, and get notified from various other systems right away, without having to leave Slack.</p>

<p>I’ve found out about support requests faster through Slack than by staring at ZenDesk all day (our ticketing system). Getting notifications on all my devices at the same time about what’s happening as its happening is a boon for me and that only drives my desire to integrate more.</p>

<p>One thing that bothers me though is autocomplete requires some fancy service on the other end in order to work. I don’t want to sit down and write middleware to tie into Slack so I can shorthand with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">/slash</code> command. I should be able to say <code class="highlighter-rouge">/ticket 12345</code> prints in chat <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://ticket.system/12345</code>. I don’t see what’s so hard about that.</p>

<p>Webhooks are super cool though and being able to touch them with 3rd party service and update my channels with relevant information is awesome. Being able to be notified in real time about anything that’s happening in another system with minimal code change is sweet. All our custom apps can push notifications, now.</p>

<p>Even well-known 3rd party services can integrate well. Some leave things to be desired like my ZenDesk-Slack integration, but I can’t blame Slack for that.</p>

<p>For a service that’s had next to no marketing done and has survived on majority word of mouth and small advertisements here and there, Slack is killing it in the real-time collaboration space.</p>

<p>Someone on my team suggested we look at HipChat, too… is it bad that I sort of don’t want to?</p>

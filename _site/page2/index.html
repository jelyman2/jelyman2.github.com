    <p>“Rails Developer” has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?</p>

<p>In my hunt to figure out where I want my career to head long term, I keep coming back to the idea of software development. I’ve told stories about how I had a rare opportunity a couple years back and I didn’t take it. Well, this time I’m the one creating the opportunity.</p>

<p>Right now I’m working on a self-paced course through <a href="http://codermanual.com">Coder Manual</a> and I’m having a great time. However, it may be billed as a complete “bootcamp” but the next stage for me really needs to be one-on-one with a touch of free-wheeling. It’s easy to follow along and build the same stuff the instructor is building. Where the real learning takes place is when free flowing creativity starts to happen.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> comes in. A long-term coding bootcamp, <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> covers front end, rails, and full stack development with the end goal of being job-ready as a junior ruby on rails developer.</p>

<p>I’ve considered other languages like Python, Java, Swift and Objective-C, but none of those really hit home for me what I want to do. Rails as a platform allows developers to build complex and fully-featured web applications that can do amazing things while not having to focus on the medial.</p>

<p>Looking forward to what’s ahead.</p>

        Returning to Morning Greatness

    <time datetime="2015-10-21T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">21 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>Yesterday I decided to shake things up a little but when it comes to my morning routine. By shake things up I mean go back to what I used to do that seemed to work so well. And by what I used to do I mean be creative.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about this struggle, before, but <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/moving-to-cali/">moving to California</a> ( <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/">and</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-2/">the</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-3/">effort</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-4/">therein</a>) really <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/reset/">messed up</a> my <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/?s=routine">routine</a>. I’ve decided enough is enough and am slowly working my way back into the old swing. Yesterday, and every day before, I would get up at 8 or even sometimes 7 AM. That’s way too late in my book. My new goal is to return to my 5 AM rise time which will allow me to exercise my mind with tasks I enjoy before work.</p>

<p>With a cup of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/09/the-cold-brew-coffee-adventure/">my home made cold brew iced coffee</a> at my desk, today is day one of that goal. I didn’t make it at 5 AM, but I did get up early. I figure every day I can push a little bit harder.</p>

<p>So what inspired all this? A little site called <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com">My Morning Routine</a>. Every Wednesday a new individual is featured on the cover and they spend a few minutes talking about their morning routine and why it’s important to them. You can follow this up with <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com/statistics/">statistics</a> on each of the routines archived and the key points to take away.</p>

<p>For example: did you know the average bed time for their respondants is 11:14 PM? That seems so late to me, but in reality, it’s not. It really depends on what you’re doing at that time. If I wanted to wake up at 5 AM, that may be a bit late, but in my case, 9 PM may not be.</p>

<p>I also found it interesting that 68% of the people featured meditate or practice yoga in some fashion. This intrigues me because of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/headspace/">my inital success with meditation</a>.</p>

<p>The stories give me some fuel to shape my own morning routine that I find to work best for me. I’ve added a bit of extra work on top from the sole fact that I’m starting this at the time of year in California when it’s dark until almost 8 AM.</p>

<p>Will it be hard? Probably, but the best things in life are the ones we have to work hardest for.</p>

<p>I look forward to documenting my progress and eventually looking back and wondering how I was able to get by with practically doing just the bare minimum to stay alive (or so it’ll likely seem).</p>

  <p>“When we did the previous mouse we spent so much time dialing those feet, the material, the geometry, everything, so that it sounds good and feels good when you move it on the table,” says Ternus, whose title is VP for Mac, iPad, Ecosystem and Audio Engineering. “But then you change the mass of the product and you change the resonant frequency of the product and all of a sudden the feet that we loved weren’t great anymore. They weren’t what we wanted.”<br />
What exactly was wrong with it? I wanted to know.<br />
“It had just changed… kind of… the sound,” says Ternus, who has been working for Apple since 2001. “They all make a noise — the question is getting a noise we like. It sounded… not right.”<a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/exclusive-why-apple-is-still-sweating-the-details-on-imac-531a95e50c91#.oqvpl2xok">Steven Levy</a> received an exclusive view into the world of development behind Apple’s new iMacs and other hardware.

    <p>I’m always looking for new an interesting ways to stimulate my brain. I’m also always looking for new ways to clear my head when necessary.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> comes in. I’ve used Headspace for a total of one day as of this writing and so far, I’m pretty impressed. Only time will tell if it’ll be worth investing money in. After my first session, I did feel a bit more relaxed and “with the program.”</p>

<p>Headspace is free with a <a href="https://www.headspace.com/buy">premium subscription</a> option. Once you get past the first level, you need to pay, but the price is pretty affordable. Paying monthly will set you back $12.95 each month. If you pay up a year in advance, it drops to the equivalvent of $7.99 a month.</p>

<p>When you start using Headspace, you’re greeted by a soft spoken gentleman (his name is <a href="https://www.headspace.com/andy-puddicombe">Andy</a>) who first walks you through the process and how Headpsace works. Once you dive in, you’re introduced to your first ten minute session. Find a place where you won’t be bothered. You don’t necessarily have to find a quiet place, as the voiceover will help you take advantage of the noise.</p>

<p>You can work through the daily meditations on your computer via <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a> or on their <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">mobile app</a> available for <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">all major mobile platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Feel like paying? Subscribing to Headspace opens up a whole host of situation-specific meditations for things like health, mental performance, and even a series on how to improve your meditation game. One category I find the most beneficial is the SOS category of meditations. If you’re working through a troubling situation or are literally freaking out, the SOS option will help you get your head back in the game and bring your mind back down to Earth.</p>

<p>I won’t give away the rest but I will say that I enjoyed my first Headspace experience. I recommend you give it a shot. I think you’l enjoy it, too. Check it out at <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a> or <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">download</a> the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">iOS</a> or <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Android</a> app.</p>

        Formula E: All the Speed Without the Noise
      </a>

    <time datetime="2015-10-19T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">19 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>Sometimes I wish this type of racing would come to my neck of the woods. In this video, Formula E is described as being the quietest race in the world.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuyxR3MRg5c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>So what is Formula E, exactly? It’s F1 racing with electricity-powered cars. Because they’re electric, they’re inherently much quieter. If you want a good idea of what to expect at a race like this, checkout the above video. For an idea of what a whole race is like, checkout the below video featuring the Formula E 2015 Round 7 race in Monaco.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juwUZGNags8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Granted, these races are much shorter (40-60 laps), but even still, these races are still exciting and the cars zip around like that Tesla you wish you owned. Watch out for the beginning action. During the broadcast they keep track of each car’s charge levels.</p>

<p>I love Formula E. It’s not on TV very often here in my market (likely because F1 races typically get delegated to some of the lesser-watched Fox networks and Comcast doesn’t carry like Fox Sports 2).</p>

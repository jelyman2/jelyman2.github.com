    <p>“Rails Developer” has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?</p>

<p>In my hunt to figure out where I want my career to head long term, I keep coming back to the idea of software development. I’ve told stories about how I had a rare opportunity a couple years back and I didn’t take it. Well, this time I’m the one creating the opportunity.</p>

<p>Right now I’m working on a self-paced course through <a href="http://codermanual.com">Coder Manual</a> and I’m having a great time. However, it may be billed as a complete “bootcamp” but the next stage for me really needs to be one-on-one with a touch of free-wheeling. It’s easy to follow along and build the same stuff the instructor is building. Where the real learning takes place is when free flowing creativity starts to happen.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> comes in. A long-term coding bootcamp, <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> covers front end, rails, and full stack development with the end goal of being job-ready as a junior ruby on rails developer.</p>

<p>I’ve considered other languages like Python, Java, Swift and Objective-C, but none of those really hit home for me what I want to do. Rails as a platform allows developers to build complex and fully-featured web applications that can do amazing things while not having to focus on the medial.</p>

<p>Looking forward to what’s ahead.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-21T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">21 Oct 2015</time>
    <p>Yesterday I decided to shake things up a little but when it comes to my morning routine. By shake things up I mean go back to what I used to do that seemed to work so well. And by what I used to do I mean be creative.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about this struggle, before, but <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/moving-to-cali/">moving to California</a> ( <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/">and</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-2/">the</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-3/">effort</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-4/">therein</a>) really <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/reset/">messed up</a> my <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/?s=routine">routine</a>. I’ve decided enough is enough and am slowly working my way back into the old swing. Yesterday, and every day before, I would get up at 8 or even sometimes 7 AM. That’s way too late in my book. My new goal is to return to my 5 AM rise time which will allow me to exercise my mind with tasks I enjoy before work.</p>

<p>With a cup of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/09/the-cold-brew-coffee-adventure/">my home made cold brew iced coffee</a> at my desk, today is day one of that goal. I didn’t make it at 5 AM, but I did get up early. I figure every day I can push a little bit harder.</p>

<p>So what inspired all this? A little site called <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com">My Morning Routine</a>. Every Wednesday a new individual is featured on the cover and they spend a few minutes talking about their morning routine and why it’s important to them. You can follow this up with <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com/statistics/">statistics</a> on each of the routines archived and the key points to take away.</p>

<p>For example: did you know the average bed time for their respondants is 11:14 PM? That seems so late to me, but in reality, it’s not. It really depends on what you’re doing at that time. If I wanted to wake up at 5 AM, that may be a bit late, but in my case, 9 PM may not be.</p>

<p>I also found it interesting that 68% of the people featured meditate or practice yoga in some fashion. This intrigues me because of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/headspace/">my inital success with meditation</a>.</p>

<p>The stories give me some fuel to shape my own morning routine that I find to work best for me. I’ve added a bit of extra work on top from the sole fact that I’m starting this at the time of year in California when it’s dark until almost 8 AM.</p>

<p>Will it be hard? Probably, but the best things in life are the ones we have to work hardest for.</p>

<p>I look forward to documenting my progress and eventually looking back and wondering how I was able to get by with practically doing just the bare minimum to stay alive (or so it’ll likely seem).</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-20T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">20 Oct 2015</time>
    <p>I’m always looking for new an interesting ways to stimulate my brain. I’m also always looking for new ways to clear my head when necessary.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> comes in. I’ve used Headspace for a total of one day as of this writing and so far, I’m pretty impressed. Only time will tell if it’ll be worth investing money in. After my first session, I did feel a bit more relaxed and “with the program.”</p>

<p>Headspace is free with a <a href="https://www.headspace.com/buy">premium subscription</a> option. Once you get past the first level, you need to pay, but the price is pretty affordable. Paying monthly will set you back $12.95 each month. If you pay up a year in advance, it drops to the equivalvent of $7.99 a month.</p>

<p>When you start using Headspace, you’re greeted by a soft spoken gentleman (his name is <a href="https://www.headspace.com/andy-puddicombe">Andy</a>) who first walks you through the process and how Headpsace works. Once you dive in, you’re introduced to your first ten minute session. Find a place where you won’t be bothered. You don’t necessarily have to find a quiet place, as the voiceover will help you take advantage of the noise.</p>

<p>You can work through the daily meditations on your computer via <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a> or on their <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">mobile app</a> available for <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">all major mobile platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Feel like paying? Subscribing to Headspace opens up a whole host of situation-specific meditations for things like health, mental performance, and even a series on how to improve your meditation game. One category I find the most beneficial is the SOS category of meditations. If you’re working through a troubling situation or are literally freaking out, the SOS option will help you get your head back in the game and bring your mind back down to Earth.</p>

<p>I won’t give away the rest but I will say that I enjoyed my first Headspace experience. I recommend you give it a shot. I think you’l enjoy it, too. Check it out at <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a> or <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">download</a> the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">iOS</a> or <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Android</a> app.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I wish this type of racing would come to my neck of the woods. In this video, Formula E is described as being the quietest race in the world.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuyxR3MRg5c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>So what is Formula E, exactly? It’s F1 racing with electricity-powered cars. Because they’re electric, they’re inherently much quieter. If you want a good idea of what to expect at a race like this, checkout the above video. For an idea of what a whole race is like, checkout the below video featuring the Formula E 2015 Round 7 race in Monaco.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juwUZGNags8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Granted, these races are much shorter (40-60 laps), but even still, these races are still exciting and the cars zip around like that Tesla you wish you owned. Watch out for the beginning action. During the broadcast they keep track of each car’s charge levels.</p>

<p>I love Formula E. It’s not on TV very often here in my market (likely because F1 races typically get delegated to some of the lesser-watched Fox networks and Comcast doesn’t carry like Fox Sports 2).</p>

    <p>Folks, serious post here. I’m participating in <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=176691">Extra Life 2015</a> in support of UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and I think it would be amazing if you <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=176691">donated</a> just a few bucks. I’ll be streaming on Twitch the 24 gaming session and will be interacting with everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=176691">Link to my Extra Life page</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. It means a lot!</p>

    <p>I’ve been a mac user for four years and I can honestly say that I’ve spent less time needing to maintain my systems than any Windows PC I’ve never owned.</p>

<p>It’s not really news that IBM rolling out the usage of Macs for its employees, but one thing that’s made at least small headlines is that after rolling out 1900 Macs a week, IBM made an <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/">announcement</a> during a talk at the <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/">JAMF Nation User Conference</a> that during their deployments and thereafter, the number of Mac users who’ve contacted their tech support for assistance has been <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/">several times</a> less than their PC counterparts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To much fanfare from the crowd, Previn said that IBM is deploying 1,900 Macs per week and currently have 130,000 Macs and iOS devices in the hands of users. And all of these devices are supported by a total of 24 help desk staff members, meaning that each staff member effectively supports 5,375 employees. One stat that particularly stood out was that 5% of Mac users call the help desk, compared to 40% of PC users. </p>

    <p>It’s pretty common knowledge that the cost of technology goes down over time, but there’s one category, as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10">highlighted</a> by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10">Buisness Insider</a> in this rather impressive graphic, that’s actually become more expensive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20151014_prices_bi.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The top line (green if you’re color blind) is the cable/satellite/radio category. What I’m not sure of is if this category covers Internet as well.</p>

<p>There are two things I know for sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s less Internet and television competition in the United States than there should be.</li>
  <li>I’m paying less than I did a few years ago.
Regarding that second point: I may be in the minority, and I probably know more than the average person on how to land the best deal possible on my information services. Part of me wonders if increasing royalties (radio) and retransmissions fees (aka broadcast network greed) are just blindly being passed on to consumers. It wouldn’t surprise me.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only way Internet prices go down is via competition. I live in an area that may someday have Google Fiber (it’s on the list of “potential” cities) and as such, Comcast charges me $135/month for roughly 175mbps of download bandwidth and 220 channels on TV including HBO, Streampix, DVR service, and whatever else that all comes with. In essence, I’m paying $67.50 a month for a 175mbps Internet connection. While Google Fiber would cost roughly $70 for the same basic prospect and raise the limit to 1000mbps, it would be hard to take advantage of that full speed without spending several hundred extra dollars to upgrade my WiFi hardware to match.</p>

<p>Needless to say, also, is that I shouldn’t have to get 220 cable channels to get that kind of price for Internet, but I do. I enjoy watching TV so in my case I get my money’s worth. Cord cutting would cost more, every month (by around +$20) and would come with siloed content services.</p>

<p>Without getting too far off course, we still shouldn’t be seeing the overall price of these services rising. It doesn’t matter the reason. If something’s moving the market in a direction that’s affecting profits, figure out how to make your service more appealing to the mass market, again, don’t just programatically raise rates to counteract and keep those coffins padded with C-notes.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-14T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">14 Oct 2015</time>
    <p>There seems to be a trend that occurs every few months with me when it comes to my writing. I find myself, and I lose myself, and I repeat. I battle with staying consistent every day and writing something, even if it’s not that interesting. When I first started blogging on a regular basis, I did it in the morning before work as a way to get my mind right and get focused for the day.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t feel like I need to do that before I go to work (my job is much more satisfying) so the time I’ve set aside to write has pretty much drifted off into space. I never came up with an alternate solution to fix this problem.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, maker of <a href="http://desk.pm">Desk</a> (the minimal blogging and publishing app collection), and habitual blogger, <a href="http://john.do">John Saddington</a> recently <a href="http://john.do/seth-on-6000/">reflected</a> on sticking with something and “ <a href="http://john.do/seth-on-6000/">showing up every day</a>” and it really gave me the boost I need to jump start my creative juices, again.</p>

<p>It’s so easy for me to blame the lack of creativity when it comes to missing a day, and there were a lot of those. When I first started this blog right after New Years 2015, I was showing up and writing several thousand words a week. Within the first twelve weeks, I put down almost 60,000 words on digital blogging paper and I enjoyed it. I cranked out thoguhts and musings every weekday morning from 5-6AM and didn’t feel like I didn’t have enough time. I just sat down and wrote.</p>

<p>When my Wife and I <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/">moved to California</a>, my routine changed, and it put a huge damper on things. We moved to an area we weren’t huge fans of, and I just couldn’t get comfortable. It was hard for me to focus, to be honest, and the environment played a huge factor.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/moving/">moved, again</a>, to a much more satisfying neighborhood, I feel like I can focus, again. I don’t feel like I’m having to battle with everything around me for some musing time.</p>

<p>When someone who’s likely written over <a href="http://john.do/9000-posts/">ten thousand</a> blog posts (9500+ of which are on <a href="http://john.do/9000-posts/">his current blog</a>) says something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>continuing to move forward, personally, professionally, whatever it may be, is the most important thing that you can be doing. Creating momentum and being as confident as you can be in those few steps is life-giving, life-changing.I pay attention. This is advice I can use not only in my side worlds, but in my personal and professional worlds, too. When it comes to improving myself to land a better job doing the next great thing with the next great company or just showing up to be the best husband that I can be to my wife is all I need. Everything else will fall into place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much has happened in the last couple years. I can’t wait to see what the next couple years have in store. The number of potential opportunties around me will grow and my time to jump will happen soon… I just have to continue working to reach my greatest level of awesome.</p>

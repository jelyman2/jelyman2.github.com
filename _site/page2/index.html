    <p>I started the Bloc Rails Web Development bootcamp three weeks ago and I’d like to go over my experiences so far.</p>

<p>The last few weeks have been pretty great, actually. There’s a lot of material to cover but it’s done in such a way that it’s broken down into small chunks. Assignments extend on the material being taught and incorporate material learned prior. Each assignment builds on the one before it and the beginning project walks you through the entire process.</p>

<p>Future projects are more open-ended and require the student to call upon what was learned in order to succeed. I am only a few weeks in after all so I haven’t been able to relfect upon the open-ended projects. However taking a cursory glance at them tells me they’re not overly challenging but they do require dedication and that you paid attention to the introductory courses.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next three weeks. With Christmas approaching, I don’t suspect I’ll be as active in the program (I’ve progressed much farther than the minimum states). After the first of the year, I predict I’ll be into one of the open projects and what I’ve learned will be tested. A challenge never hurts.</p>

    <p>It’s easy to miss the small picture when looking at the big picture. Thinking about what I have ahead of me in terms of the next year at Bloc gives me two thoughts: it’s going to take a long time and it’s easy to not see the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>Bloc is a long program. It covers a lot of material in great detail. For the un-initiated, it can take quite some time. I’m told that based on my 72-week track, I should be doing five “checkpoints” per week. It’s Tuesday and I’ve killed seven. I know it might not always be like this and the first weeks are always the “yeah let’s do this!” weeks. As time goes on, the sheer size of the program will really start to show itself but the one thing I’ll need to keep in mind is that no matter how many different <em>things</em> I still have to do, I need to just focus on one at a time.</p>

<p>Before I know it, I’ll be done.</p>

    <p>I officially signed up last week for Bloc.io’s Full-stack developer bootcamp becuase I feel while I can learn a good deal of stuff on my own, I’m not going to make on my own to the level I need to be in order to make a fundamental career shift to software development that will actually still support my family.</p>

<p>The program doesn’t officially start until the 9th of November so I have a little over a week to go. It’ll be a long year and change and a lot of new stuff will come my way. I’ve only scratched the surface of what Ruby and Rails can do. I started a simple Rails app a couple days ago that could one day turn into the platform for any and all of my sites, if I stick to it, enough. Right now, I don’t know enough on how to make it great.</p>

<p>With time, I will, and as I progress the app will improve. My goal is to one day have it replace WordPress as my blog, portfolio of work, and anything else about me I feature online. I may even adapt it to restart my photography portfolio.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to what I’ll be learning in the coming months and I’ll be sure to share all of it with you.</p>

    <p>I came across a small issue this afternoon while building out one of my first Ruby on Rails apps. When I generated the database table, I misspelled a column name. Luckily for me, it’s easy enough to fix and this is how I did it.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-new-migration">1. Create a New Migration</h3>
<p>At the command line from within your Rails application folder, run this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/d6017c61588d2bfbe2fa.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/d6017c61588d2bfbe2fa">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p>You’ll be generating a new database migration with the name FixColumnName (which interprets to <code class="highlighter-rouge">[timestamp]_fix_column_name.rb</code>) inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db/migrate</code> folder inside your rails application. Open that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.rb</code> file and update it so it looks something like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/2e29faf460cff05f803b.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/2e29faf460cff05f803b">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">:table_name</code> – the name of the table in question</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">:old_column</code> – the misspelled column name<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">:new_column</code> – the correct column nameIf you have multiple columns you need to change, introduce additional <code class="highlighter-rouge">rename_column</code> functions:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/9ea9fba6529008ed08dc.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/9ea9fba6529008ed08dc">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p>Keep in mind that after this migration, you’ll need to update your references to the column everywhere within your app.</p>

<p>Seems like a simple fix but as someone who’s relatively new to Ruby on Rails, this saved me a load of time figuring out what to do and preventing me from starting over.</p>

    <p>“Rails Developer” has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?</p>

<p>In my hunt to figure out where I want my career to head long term, I keep coming back to the idea of software development. I’ve told stories about how I had a rare opportunity a couple years back and I didn’t take it. Well, this time I’m the one creating the opportunity.</p>

<p>Right now I’m working on a self-paced course through <a href="http://codermanual.com">Coder Manual</a> and I’m having a great time. However, it may be billed as a complete “bootcamp” but the next stage for me really needs to be one-on-one with a touch of free-wheeling. It’s easy to follow along and build the same stuff the instructor is building. Where the real learning takes place is when free flowing creativity starts to happen.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> comes in. A long-term coding bootcamp, <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> covers front end, rails, and full stack development with the end goal of being job-ready as a junior ruby on rails developer.</p>

<p>I’ve considered other languages like Python, Java, Swift and Objective-C, but none of those really hit home for me what I want to do. Rails as a platform allows developers to build complex and fully-featured web applications that can do amazing things while not having to focus on the medial.</p>

<p>Looking forward to what’s ahead.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I decided to shake things up a little but when it comes to my morning routine. By shake things up I mean go back to what I used to do that seemed to work so well. And by what I used to do I mean be creative.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about this struggle, before, but <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/moving-to-cali/">moving to California</a> ( <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/">and</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-2/">the</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-3/">effort</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-4/">therein</a>) really <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/reset/">messed up</a> my <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/?s=routine">routine</a>. I’ve decided enough is enough and am slowly working my way back into the old swing. Yesterday, and every day before, I would get up at 8 or even sometimes 7 AM. That’s way too late in my book. My new goal is to return to my 5 AM rise time which will allow me to exercise my mind with tasks I enjoy before work.</p>

<p>With a cup of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/09/the-cold-brew-coffee-adventure/">my home made cold brew iced coffee</a> at my desk, today is day one of that goal. I didn’t make it at 5 AM, but I did get up early. I figure every day I can push a little bit harder.</p>

<p>So what inspired all this? A little site called <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com">My Morning Routine</a>. Every Wednesday a new individual is featured on the cover and they spend a few minutes talking about their morning routine and why it’s important to them. You can follow this up with <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com/statistics/">statistics</a> on each of the routines archived and the key points to take away.</p>

<p>For example: did you know the average bed time for their respondants is 11:14 PM? That seems so late to me, but in reality, it’s not. It really depends on what you’re doing at that time. If I wanted to wake up at 5 AM, that may be a bit late, but in my case, 9 PM may not be.</p>

<p>I also found it interesting that 68% of the people featured meditate or practice yoga in some fashion. This intrigues me because of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/headspace/">my inital success with meditation</a>.</p>

<p>The stories give me some fuel to shape my own morning routine that I find to work best for me. I’ve added a bit of extra work on top from the sole fact that I’m starting this at the time of year in California when it’s dark until almost 8 AM.</p>

<p>Will it be hard? Probably, but the best things in life are the ones we have to work hardest for.</p>

<p>I look forward to documenting my progress and eventually looking back and wondering how I was able to get by with practically doing just the bare minimum to stay alive (or so it’ll likely seem).</p>

    <p>I’m always looking for new an interesting ways to stimulate my brain. I’m also always looking for new ways to clear my head when necessary.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> comes in. I’ve used Headspace for a total of one day as of this writing and so far, I’m pretty impressed. Only time will tell if it’ll be worth investing money in. After my first session, I did feel a bit more relaxed and “with the program.”</p>

<p>Headspace is free with a <a href="https://www.headspace.com/buy">premium subscription</a> option. Once you get past the first level, you need to pay, but the price is pretty affordable. Paying monthly will set you back $12.95 each month. If you pay up a year in advance, it drops to the equivalvent of $7.99 a month.</p>

<p>When you start using Headspace, you’re greeted by a soft spoken gentleman (his name is <a href="https://www.headspace.com/andy-puddicombe">Andy</a>) who first walks you through the process and how Headpsace works. Once you dive in, you’re introduced to your first ten minute session. Find a place where you won’t be bothered. You don’t necessarily have to find a quiet place, as the voiceover will help you take advantage of the noise.</p>

<p>You can work through the daily meditations on your computer via <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a> or on their <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">mobile app</a> available for <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">all major mobile platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Feel like paying? Subscribing to Headspace opens up a whole host of situation-specific meditations for things like health, mental performance, and even a series on how to improve your meditation game. One category I find the most beneficial is the SOS category of meditations. If you’re working through a troubling situation or are literally freaking out, the SOS option will help you get your head back in the game and bring your mind back down to Earth.</p>

<p>I won’t give away the rest but I will say that I enjoyed my first Headspace experience. I recommend you give it a shot. I think you’l enjoy it, too. Check it out at <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a> or <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">download</a> the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">iOS</a> or <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Android</a> app.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I wish this type of racing would come to my neck of the woods. In this video, Formula E is described as being the quietest race in the world.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuyxR3MRg5c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>So what is Formula E, exactly? It’s F1 racing with electricity-powered cars. Because they’re electric, they’re inherently much quieter. If you want a good idea of what to expect at a race like this, checkout the above video. For an idea of what a whole race is like, checkout the below video featuring the Formula E 2015 Round 7 race in Monaco.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juwUZGNags8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Granted, these races are much shorter (40-60 laps), but even still, these races are still exciting and the cars zip around like that Tesla you wish you owned. Watch out for the beginning action. During the broadcast they keep track of each car’s charge levels.</p>

<p>I love Formula E. It’s not on TV very often here in my market (likely because F1 races typically get delegated to some of the lesser-watched Fox networks and Comcast doesn’t carry like Fox Sports 2).</p>

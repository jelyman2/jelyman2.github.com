    <p>Folks, serious post here. I’m participating in <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=176691">Extra Life 2015</a> in support of UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and I think it would be amazing if you <a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=176691">donated</a> just a few bucks. I’ll be streaming on Twitch the 24 gaming session and will be interacting with everyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=176691">Link to my Extra Life page</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. It means a lot!</p>

        Macs Equal Fewer Helpdesk Calls

    <time datetime="2015-10-16T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">16 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>I’ve been a mac user for four years and I can honestly say that I’ve spent less time needing to maintain my systems than any Windows PC I’ve never owned.</p>

<p>It’s not really news that IBM rolling out the usage of Macs for its employees, but one thing that’s made at least small headlines is that after rolling out 1900 Macs a week, IBM made an <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/">announcement</a> during a talk at the <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/">JAMF Nation User Conference</a> that during their deployments and thereafter, the number of Mac users who’ve contacted their tech support for assistance has been <a href="http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/">several times</a> less than their PC counterparts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To much fanfare from the crowd, Previn said that IBM is deploying 1,900 Macs per week and currently have 130,000 Macs and iOS devices in the hands of users. And all of these devices are supported by a total of 24 help desk staff members, meaning that each staff member effectively supports 5,375 employees. One stat that particularly stood out was that 5% of Mac users call the help desk, compared to 40% of PC users. </p>

        The Costs of Technology

    <time datetime="2015-10-14T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">14 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>It’s pretty common knowledge that the cost of technology goes down over time, but there’s one category, as <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10">highlighted</a> by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10">Buisness Insider</a> in this rather impressive graphic, that’s actually become more expensive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historical-price-trends-for-tech-products-2015-10"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20151014_prices_bi.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The top line (green if you’re color blind) is the cable/satellite/radio category. What I’m not sure of is if this category covers Internet as well.</p>

<p>There are two things I know for sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s less Internet and television competition in the United States than there should be.</li>
  <li>I’m paying less than I did a few years ago.
Regarding that second point: I may be in the minority, and I probably know more than the average person on how to land the best deal possible on my information services. Part of me wonders if increasing royalties (radio) and retransmissions fees (aka broadcast network greed) are just blindly being passed on to consumers. It wouldn’t surprise me.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only way Internet prices go down is via competition. I live in an area that may someday have Google Fiber (it’s on the list of “potential” cities) and as such, Comcast charges me $135/month for roughly 175mbps of download bandwidth and 220 channels on TV including HBO, Streampix, DVR service, and whatever else that all comes with. In essence, I’m paying $67.50 a month for a 175mbps Internet connection. While Google Fiber would cost roughly $70 for the same basic prospect and raise the limit to 1000mbps, it would be hard to take advantage of that full speed without spending several hundred extra dollars to upgrade my WiFi hardware to match.</p>

<p>Needless to say, also, is that I shouldn’t have to get 220 cable channels to get that kind of price for Internet, but I do. I enjoy watching TV so in my case I get my money’s worth. Cord cutting would cost more, every month (by around +$20) and would come with siloed content services.</p>

<p>Without getting too far off course, we still shouldn’t be seeing the overall price of these services rising. It doesn’t matter the reason. If something’s moving the market in a direction that’s affecting profits, figure out how to make your service more appealing to the mass market, again, don’t just programatically raise rates to counteract and keep those coffins padded with C-notes.</p>

        On Never Quitting

    <time datetime="2015-10-14T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">14 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>There seems to be a trend that occurs every few months with me when it comes to my writing. I find myself, and I lose myself, and I repeat. I battle with staying consistent every day and writing something, even if it’s not that interesting. When I first started blogging on a regular basis, I did it in the morning before work as a way to get my mind right and get focused for the day.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t feel like I need to do that before I go to work (my job is much more satisfying) so the time I’ve set aside to write has pretty much drifted off into space. I never came up with an alternate solution to fix this problem.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, maker of <a href="http://desk.pm">Desk</a> (the minimal blogging and publishing app collection), and habitual blogger, <a href="http://john.do">John Saddington</a> recently <a href="http://john.do/seth-on-6000/">reflected</a> on sticking with something and “ <a href="http://john.do/seth-on-6000/">showing up every day</a>” and it really gave me the boost I need to jump start my creative juices, again.</p>

<p>It’s so easy for me to blame the lack of creativity when it comes to missing a day, and there were a lot of those. When I first started this blog right after New Years 2015, I was showing up and writing several thousand words a week. Within the first twelve weeks, I put down almost 60,000 words on digital blogging paper and I enjoyed it. I cranked out thoguhts and musings every weekday morning from 5-6AM and didn’t feel like I didn’t have enough time. I just sat down and wrote.</p>

<p>When my Wife and I <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/">moved to California</a>, my routine changed, and it put a huge damper on things. We moved to an area we weren’t huge fans of, and I just couldn’t get comfortable. It was hard for me to focus, to be honest, and the environment played a huge factor.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/moving/">moved, again</a>, to a much more satisfying neighborhood, I feel like I can focus, again. I don’t feel like I’m having to battle with everything around me for some musing time.</p>

<p>When someone who’s likely written over <a href="http://john.do/9000-posts/">ten thousand</a> blog posts (9500+ of which are on <a href="http://john.do/9000-posts/">his current blog</a>) says something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>continuing to move forward, personally, professionally, whatever it may be, is the most important thing that you can be doing. Creating momentum and being as confident as you can be in those few steps is life-giving, life-changing.I pay attention. This is advice I can use not only in my side worlds, but in my personal and professional worlds, too. When it comes to improving myself to land a better job doing the next great thing with the next great company or just showing up to be the best husband that I can be to my wife is all I need. Everything else will fall into place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much has happened in the last couple years. I can’t wait to see what the next couple years have in store. The number of potential opportunties around me will grow and my time to jump will happen soon… I just have to continue working to reach my greatest level of awesome.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-11T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">11 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>Every time we meet or communicate with someone, be it face to face, over the phone (who does that anymore), text message, email, Skype, etc., we have a fresh opportunity to make the best of the situation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/">High Existence</a> has a great <a href="http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/">article</a> listing 25 “ <a href="http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/">life hacks</a>” to make the most of social situations. Number eight is key for me. I’m terrible at remembering names. Number 12 is so true, too.</p>

<p>The key in all this isn’t to necessarily dominate in a conversation, but to use certain things, triggers, the environment, and each others strengths and weaknesses to your advantage.</p>

<p>I’ll admit there are quite a few in this article that I could learn and use in my own life.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Have I not destroyed my enemy when I have made him into my friend? ~ Abraham Lincoln</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So often we spend all of our time trying to literally destroy our enemies and fail to understand that while it may feel good in the short term to have conquered someone with negativity, we’re just terrible people.</p>

<p>It’s easy to say that while not in the heat of the moment, and sure, words slip from time to time. The point is that using words to put someone down—accidentally or otherwise—didn’t just happen by chance.</p>

<p>Instead of using all this energy to bring someone down to your level or below, why not lift them up? There may be a reason why you dislike an individual today, but that reason may not exist for ever.</p>

<p>There are actions that once committed lead to irreversable consiquences, and in those cases, it’s wise to just move on without that person in or around your life.</p>

<p>For everyone else, you might be surprised how easy it is to defeat your enemies by becoming friends with them. You might find that whatever was bothering you about them wasn’t actually that bad, after all.</p>

    <p>Going to keep this one simple: I wish High School had prepared me for real life. High School never taught me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Real money management</li>
  <li>Taxes</li>
  <li>Real job search skills</li>
  <li>Computer engineering</li>
  <li>Neutral views on social issues
You know what I did learn? A lot about the past. It seemed like every class taught me stuff that people discovered a long time ago, but not how it was relevant to the present day. Homer wrote some books and some mathematical equations were discovered quite some time ago, but how can I apply this to real life, the life that’s in the present?</li>
</ul>

<p>When I find out, I’ll tell you, because high school didn’t.</p>

<p><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ScreenShot2015-10-10at12.05.52PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://xqsuperschool.org">XQ, The Super School Project</a> aims to reinvent the high school and make it something that can acutally teach kids what’s relevant for today’s world. We’re not just talking about stuff like how to program. Learning [subject] is important, but not in the context of memorization and anecdotal fact memorization (the current method); [subject] is important in the context of how it can be applied today, right now. What about Greek Mythology can I use right now, to do something or make an advancement in my career or society?</p>

<p>Also a good question.</p>

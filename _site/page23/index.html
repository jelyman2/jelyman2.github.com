    <p>One thing I’ve always found so amazing is that with today’s excellent blend of technologies to keep people living longer, we regularly see people living past 100 years of age.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you live to be 109 years old? Exercise, a nice warm bowl of porridge, and staying away from men—at least that’s the explanation given by Scotland’s oldest woman, Jessie Gallan, in a story that  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2912299/Scotland-s-oldest-woman-Jessie-Gallan-reveals-longevity-secrets-including-eating-porridge-avoiding-men.html">went viral earlier this year</a>.[<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/15/how-the-world-s-oldest-people-live-so-long.html">s</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It’s quite wild to think that there’s a possibility I might live to be that long. Shortly after that realization another one hits: I’m going to need to save more for retirement. Most retirement plans account for 20-30 years between retirement and death. If I want to stick to my valiant plans of retiring at 55, I’m going to need more than that. If I’m Jessie, I’ll need 50 years. Oh boy. Good thing there are services to help manage money out there. I’m not sure I could do that on my own.</p>

<p>I’m not even going to start on the age of the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2572316/The-secret-long-life-Sushi-sleep-according-worlds-oldest-woman.html">oldest living woman</a> at 118 years. I just can’t. It’s daunting to think that there’s so much more life left to live after retirement for some people. Usually when you reach that point, things change and daily life changes. I don’t think I could deal with that for over 60 years.</p>

<p>Then again, I could just retire later, too.</p>

<p>That’s so long from now, God only knows what’ll happen.</p>

    <p>Comcast, I hope you’re reading this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SageTV founder (and current Google employee) Jeffrey Kardatzke says that Google “has agreed to open-source the SageTV platform.”[<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/16/google-open-sourcing-sage-tv/?ncid=rss_truncated">s</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar, SageTV has been off the market for a few years now after being one of the first to release a DVR box and home theater PC software title. Google bought it up and pulled it away, only to end up using it in their Google Fiber TV box.</p>

<p>It’s great to see this kind of move. There’s a lot of capability in set top boxes that go untouched. I can speak from experience with my X1 box from Comcast. I have HDMI in and out, of which I can only use the OUT. I also have USB and Ethernet, both of which do nothing. I would love to be able to use the ethernet jack instead. It would behoove Comcast to switch to an IPTV-type setup, instead. The bandwidth of traditional cable (QAM256) is limited to something like 39mbps per channel, and each channel is typically split in half (since there aren’t enough channels in the spectrum for 1:1 usage). That brings us down to 19.8mbps per channel, at max. That’s not bad, but it could be better. Blu-Ray discs are usually 25-35mbps for video and roughly 5-8mbps for audio. Compressed 5.1 is roughly 1.5mbps so taking that out of our 19.8mbps stream leaves us with 18.3mbps.</p>

<p>But enough about that. I can ramble about the quality of a TV signal all day. The point is that each stream could be any number of bits in size, not just a technological maximum of 19.8mbps. The trick would be switching streams in a timely manner and implementing some pretty hardcore QoS all along the pipe to ensure the TV signal doesn’t become degraded because your kids are having a LAN party in their room and sucking up all the Internets.</p>

<p>Even without a move to IPTV, opening up a box to other apps and developers would make for a much more desirable platform, regardless of the vendor. One thing I’ve always wanted on my X1 was a Netflix app. Will that happen? Probably not, so long as Comcast has a beef with Netflix.</p>

<p>The trick will be to not let too many crazy things through the flood gates. If app developers start making shoddy apps, the quality of service for the entire system becomes compromised, and we know how Google loves to keep Android and open platform and what that ultimately does for the quality of apps.</p>

  <p>You can’t think yourself out of a writing block; you have to write yourself out of a thinking block.  — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)" title="John Rogers">John Rogers</a>These words are very true, and I have the experience to back them up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last week, I spent 30 minutes <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half-hour" title="Half Hour of Random">writing non-stop</a>. I didn’t think about what I was writing, nor did I stop to even see if what I wrote flowed. At the end, I just published it. The premise behind that exercise was to not just pad my monthly word count, but to simply see what ideas come to mind as I write.</p>

<p>The result was quite interesting. There were clear transitions between topics, but each of those topics was a morph from the one previous. It’s as though when I was discussing one thing, another idea started forming in my mind.</p>

<p>Another prime example is just today when I was discussing <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/sage" title="Open-Source SageTV">SageTV</a>. I started going on about QAM 256 and channel bandwidth and other non-related stuff all to come back to the point of there being better ways to go about executing a set top box in 2015 like what Google’s doing.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)" title="John Rogers">Rogers</a> is talking about. I could easily have another couple posts right there about things I have at least some knowledge of. I could explain the intricacies of QAM and bore the hell out of you. I could also explain why open-sourcing a set-top box is both a great and a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Perhaps I will. Who knows. The point is that I wouldn’t have even thought of those topics to talk about had I not written about them.</p>

<p>This is one of the many reasons why I like writing on a regular basis. There isn’t some massive end-goal in mind. I’m not trying to build a mega-blog full of money-making ideas that I can litter with ads and end up in a penthouse. Not even close. I write because it stimulates my mind and gives me new things to talk about and new ideas to ponder. There isn’t another medium of creativity where I’ve been able to work out how to write at a pace of almost 3500 words an hour.</p>

<p>Some say I should really write a book.</p>

    <p>Voyager 1 and 2. Covering a million miles a day, these two crafts are still humming along. After 40 years of travel, they still gather data, and some of the original crew still watch over them… even if they do so from a simple office park in Pasadena.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/15/voyager-1-and-2-space-journey-nasa">Reading about Steve Howard</a>, 65, the man who’s in a group of people controlling the space crafts from 16 light hours away, is quite humbling. Voyager 1 took a “family photo” of the solar system 25 years ago and in 2036, will shut down. Most sensors will do so long before the nine 2025 as its Plutonium-238 reactor dwindles into nothingness, but an eleven more years is still an impressive feat. </p>

<p>Howard will be 90 by then. There isn’t much of a change either Voyager will find anything super interesting until 40,000 years from now, when they’ll be dead metal and nothing more.</p>

<p>The next time you complain your internet is slow, think about Steve and his 17 34 hour round-trip transmission time from his computer, through the Deep Space Network, to Voyager 1. </p>

    <p>I’ve been mulling this idea over in my head for a few weeks, now and now I think it’s time to start it. I’m starting a series of posts on various managed WordPress offerings and my impressions of them. Since I run a WordPress site by hand, I believe it’ll allow me to have a fair point of view when it comes to transitioning to a managed service.</p>

<p>What I’ll be looking for is a roughly the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signup Process. How easy was it to sign up for the service?</li>
  <li>Migration. How much time would it take to migrate a site and if it costs more, how much extra?</li>
  <li>Launching. How easy it is to go live from the time the account becomes active?</li>
  <li>Extra Features. Are things like SSL and CDNs included? Are they limited to certain plans? </li>
  <li>Price Point. How much would it cost to get into the service?</li>
  <li>Free Trials. This is a big one for a lot of people. Does the service have a free trial that can be exercised? 
Here’s a list of the services I plan on going over in the next month or so:</li>
</ul>

<p>Flywheel<br />
Kinsta<br />
Pagely<br />
MediaTemple<br />
DreamHost<br />
Pantheon<br />
WPEngine<br />
WordPress.com<br />
Synthesis<br />
Pressable</p>

<p>If you have any other services you’d like to see covered, please let me know in the comments below.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

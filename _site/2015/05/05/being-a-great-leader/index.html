  <time datetime="2015-05-05T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">05 May 2015</time>
  <p>I was reading a <a href="http://john.do/children-over-soccer/">recent post</a> from Indie <a href="//desk.pm">software developer</a> and <a href="//john.do">blogger John Saddington</a> this evening about a story relating to being a soccer coach for a youth team.</p>

<p>It was a good story and like a lot of what he shares, there was a life lesson to be had. One particular sentence stood out to me the most and it’s the one that I kept thinking about even after I finished reading.</p>

<p>John <a href="http://john.do/children-over-soccer/">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reality was that the children needed coaches who loved them,  <a href="http://john.do/love-play/">who loved watching them play</a>, and who wanted to continue to <strong>concretely encourage them to pursue the sport beyond their current age bracket</strong>. [emphasis mine]That last bit in bold really stuck with me and made me think about where I’ve worked in the past and what I’m doing now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, I’ve worked a variety of IT-related positions but none of them really pushed me to continue to do more. I felt I had to do the pushing myself because the job wasn’t ultimately going to lead to a career. At one point, I had made that such a thing that when I opted to not push, things didn’t go according to plan. Hindsight was definitely 20/20 on that one.</p>

<p>In the present now, I’m in a position where I can make an impact on someone on a regular basis. Part of my day-to-day is not just pointing a team of talented people in the right direction in their day-to-day work, but pointing them in the right direction  <strong>and</strong> pushing them in their careers.</p>

<p>In order to be a good great leader, one has to be willing to invest in the betterment of his or her team. I have a particular friend who works for a broadcasting company that on a regular basis takes time and effort out of their day to provide resources and insight so their team can turn their careers into something they’ll really enjoy, even if the end result isn’t working with him.</p>

<p>I technically work in customer service but it’s so much more than that. I also work in employee service. I’m not just a Senior Technical Support Lead, I’m a Senior Team Betterment Lead, a Leader in Career Development, and a Master of Taking the Next Step. It’s important to take time and pursue other people’s goals with them.</p>

<p>A perfect example of that is <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/moving-to-cali/">moving to California</a>. I picked up my career and left an area I grew up in so <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support/">my wife</a> can grow in herself and her career. I created a very real opportunity for her by putting what I wanted in second place. Similarly in the professional world, I would rather watch a member of my team grow and move on to something better than have them stay in the same job that would otherwise end up being a dead end.</p>

<p>If by the end of our time together I’ve been able to give you the tools you need to expand and grow and take that next step in your career, then I’ve done my job.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to be bored of the sun?</p>

<p>Maybe it’s not that I’m bored of seeing the sun every day. Maybe it’s that I’m just drying out.</p>

<p>As you’re probably well aware, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/about/">I’m from Seattle</a>. I grew up in the Seattle metro area and spent my entire life there. Only recently did I <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/moving-to-cali/">end up moving</a>. Of all places I could have moved, I landed in Northern California. I did so because the next phase in my wife’s professional life was upon her and it’s only fair that <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/being-a-great-leader/">I support her</a>. <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/my-support/">She supports me</a> on a daily basis, as well.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-4/">moved into</a> our apartment on April 7. Since then, it’s rained twice for roughly a total of 1.75 inches. As of today, we’ve been here a month… 30 days to be exact.</p>

<p>Did I mention it was April?</p>

<p>Where I come from, 1.75” is a weekly thing in April.</p>

<p>Not in California. Apparently we’re all going to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/08/04/1318778/-California-is-dying-of-thrist-while-it-uses-much-of-its-precious-water-to-raise-livestock-in-China">die of thirst</a>, if the media is to be believed.</p>

<p>People keep asking me if I’m enjoying the nice weather. I tell them I am, because it’s true. I’m really enjoying not having to wear a jacket all the time. I’m enjoying being able to wear shorts.</p>

<p>But the weather might be boring me. I’m not really bored of the sun, per se, just bored of the same thing every day.</p>

<p>Granted, Seattle gets a lot more rain and many I’m sure would argue that having “blah” for weather nine months out of the year sucks.</p>

<p>Which it does. But it doesn’t happen all at once.</p>

<p>But as I write this, I’m starting to ponder the idea that maybe it’s not even that I’m bored of seeing the same thing every day when I look out the window. Maybe it’s that I’m just not used to seeing the same blue sky every day in April and May.</p>

<p>This kind of weather typically showed up in July in Seattle. That’s my birthday month. It’s a good time of the year.</p>

<p>April’s been historically miserable outside. May is so-so.</p>

<p>I have some changing to do.</p>

<p>I need to keep this tan going.</p>

<p>I need to embrace the sun.</p>

<p>I’m thirsty.</p>

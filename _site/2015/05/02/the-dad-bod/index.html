  <h1 class="post-title">The Dad Bod</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">02 May 2015</time>
  <p>I came across <a href="http://theodysseyonline.com/clemson/dad-bod/97484">The Dad Bod on The Odyssey Online</a> this afternoon that at first seemed like a joke but turned out to be completely legitimate.</p>

<p>There’s a look that (at least some) women are after called The Dad Bod look. Mackenzie Pearson explains the incredibly fresh term as such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dad bod says, “I go to the gym occasionally, but I also drink heavily on the weekends and enjoy eating eight slices of pizza at a time.” It’s not an overweight guy, but it isn’t one with washboard abs, either.After thinking about this for a moment, I came to realize that I probably fit in this category, so I continued reading. It’s unfortunate that this all seems to be sources from the teenage generation, but if anyone is going to make up a new trend, it’ll be those who source their vocabulary from The Urban Dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pearson runs off a few items on her list of why a Dad Bod isn’t a bad thing, and what women (I’m sure in a generalized way) like about the “look” that’s nothing more than you enjoy McDonalds but not for three people, daily. I won’t go over them all because that’d spoil the fun of reading the article yourself. The one I enjoyed the most is the last one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Girls tend to picture their future together with their guys early on. Therefore, if he already has the dad bod going on, we can get used to it before we date him, marry him, have three kids. We know what we are getting into when he’s got the same exact body type at the age of 22 that he’s going to have at 45.Gotta play it safe, right? I get it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking about myself, I realize I probably fit in this category. I’m 5’11”, 195lbs. I’m not super skinny but I’m also not of the plumber variety. This probably explains why my wife insists she’s ok with the less-than-chiseled look I have going on.</p>

<p>Reading the comments was nothing short of amusing, but this one stood out the most:</p>

<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-15.59.26.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-15.59.26.png?resize=689%2C98" alt="Screenshot 2015-05-02 15.59.26" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not going to lie, I could probably go for a run now and then. I might have gone over the 50% muscle-beer gut line a few steps but one thing’s for sure: I’m surely not going to plan out my bland-as-hell meals for the week and expect me to always be okay with pizza.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/04/30/what_is_the_dad_bod_america_s_leading_expert_explains.html">Slate interviewed Pearson</a> on what exactly a Dad Bod is and the responses she’s received from men and women alike.</p>

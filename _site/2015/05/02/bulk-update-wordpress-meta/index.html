  <h1 class="post-title">Bulk Updating Any Meta Values in WordPress Posts Automatically</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-05-02T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">02 May 2015</time>
  <p>I updated the look of my site, today, and with that came a non-standard setup for featured images and the realization I’d have to manually update a lot of posts.</p>

<p>The theme requires custom meta be used for the featured image setting to determine how to display an image. As of this post, I have roughly 170 blog posts in the database that would need updating from the beginning of January until now. I definitely didn’t want to spend the next 60 minutes (170 posts * time to click) updating each post, so I did a bit of quick and dirty PHP coding.</p>

<p>Placing the code within the_loop() allowed it to run automatically for each post that was presented. Setting the per-page post count to 200, I effectively had all 170 posts pushed on screen at the same time. This subsequently updated all 170 posts at the same time. This of course put a little bit of a hit on my SQL database, but not so much that it bogged it down. I’m sure having 170 * 2 reads then writes all at once blew out a few of the cobwebs. Most of this site is cached pretty effectively so the database doesn’t do much.</p>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-18.23.56.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-02-18.23.56.png?resize=882%2C359" alt="Screenshot 2015-05-02 18.23.56" /></a></p>

<p>You’ll see in the image above where I made the updates. The first spike should have been the only one, but I entered the wrong value for one of the custom meta fields so I had to go back and do it again. The code has logic so if it was already correct, it skipped it, hence the smaller second peak.</p>

<p>If you’re curious, the above came from <a href="http://newrelic.com">NewRelic</a>, a service offering made by some pretty cool people. They’re free to use for the basic stuff and their customer service rocks. &lt;/shameless plug&gt;</p>

<p>Anyway, without further delay, here’s the code that made this happen:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/56c68169e85ae18ce62c.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/56c68169e85ae18ce62c">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p>Pretty neat, eh? I know it’s nothing spectacular but it gets the job done, for sure.</p>

<p>Share this post with everyone you know who’s even just remotely interested in WordPress development. One could even bulk-update posts themselves with zero clicks or interaction necessary.</p>

<p>I feel like I did a great thing, today. Time for a beer.</p>

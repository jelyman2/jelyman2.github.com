  <time datetime="2015-04-12T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">12 Apr 2015</time>
  <p>Today’s the day. We packed up all our stuff over the last couple of weeks and picked up our moving truck this morning. We loaded it all in a relatively short amount of time (we do only have an apartment, after all). So far, the trip’s been alright, as we haven’t left town, yet, and won’t until tomorrow morning. Funny story, though…</p>

<p>We were up at 6:30 getting ready to start the long day. I’m dreading the level of effort that’s about to be bestowed upon me by the laws of gravity and physics. By 7:30 we had breakfast. Thanks Jack in the Box!</p>

<p>By 8:00am, we were at the rental truck facility. By virtue of being the lowest price for our one-way trip, we graced Budget Truck with our presence. The place looked kinda sketchy and rightly so: it was nothing more than a double-wide. For a place that also offered rental cars via Avis, it was hard to tell what cars were actually available to rent.</p>

<p>At 8:30 we had the truck back home and ready to accept our crap. Most of our stuff was already boxed up so it came down to making trips two and from the truck with the dolly. This part only took a couple hours. Most of our furniture was boxed up (we ordered some new stuff, because why not!).</p>

<p>Come 10:30 and we’re back at Budget Truck ready for our car trailer. We’re taking a 22-foot truck (16 feet cargo space plus six feet for the chassis, give or take) and adding another 16.5-foot trailer on the back. I love the plan. This $45 trailer will net us $150 in gas savings.</p>

<p>Did I mention we have a cat? No? Well… we have a cat, and this is where it starts getting interesting.</p>

<p>It’s now 12:00 and we’re at our hotel, the Holiday In Express &amp; Suites. I’ve stayed there before and they were pretty nice for a 3-star hotel. I expected more nice-but-not-worthy-of-instagramming experiences. We checked in, and informed them of our cat, because I want to make sure the reservation at a pet-friendly hotel was still legitimate. Turns out it was, they are pet friendly. As it also turns out, they charge $50 per three nights as an added fee, like paying for a room for your pet. Oh… but according to Hanna, the wonderfully nice woman at the reception desk explained the moment she, herself discovered for the first time it seemed, they don’t take cats.</p>

<p>So there’s that.</p>

<p>I’m in a bit of a subdued panic because our whole schedule is pretty well locked down. We already turned in our apartment keys and for all intents and purposes, we’re transients. I’ll be honest, I paid $90 for my room through Hotwire. I thought it was a good deal. That’s about the price I paid the last time I stayed at HIES via Hotwire, roughly two to three years ago.</p>

<p>I give Hotwire a call, crossing my fingers they’ll refund my non-refundable purchase. Turns out they will, only if the room and or reservation isn’t as advertised. I had the right in two areas: 1) they were only <em>partially</em> pet friendly, something Hotwire didn’t advertise properly, and 2) the rate on Hotwire’s site should have been the only amount I had to pay, which it wasn’t. After roughly five minutes, it was all squared away and I had my money back.</p>

<p>But now what? I’m without a hotel room. In comes my trusty hotel sidekick to the rescue.</p>

<p>There’s a single hotel chain that’s always come through for my family and my wife’s family alike, the La Quinta. It’s roughly on the same level as HIES, and about the same price. I gave them a rang because I know their properties and know what kind of rooms they offer up. An ever so friendly gentleman named Kurtis (I checked, he spells it that way) helped us out. They had a room open tonight and they were pet friendly. They also don’t charge a fee, because that’s weird.</p>

<p>Since I’m a AAA member, they took 10% off and we were in business for $100. Sure it was $10 more, but I’d rather pay that difference than $50. It was within reason. Within 20 minutes we had our room and were moving in for the night.</p>

<p>It’s 1:00pm and nap time.</p>

<p>At around 3:30, my wife found it prudent to give our other hotel reservations a call and find out if they charge a separate pet fee. Turns out they both did. The Ramada in Medford, OR charges $20, and the Double Tree in Newark, CA charges $50. The $20 is okay, the $50 is not. I called Hotwire again, and complained once more. I fed them a story about false advertising and whatnot, and within a few minutes I had my money back, again. It would be great if Hotwire advertised extra fees like this before you buy your supposedly non-refundable stay.</p>

<p>I enjoyed our stay at the La Quinta. While it’s nothing special to look at they’re good at making breakfast and having comfy beds. They could step up their WiFi game a bit. The particular hotel I stayed at had misconfigured WiFi. All of their hotspots were on the same channel. If you’re not technically inclined enough to know what that means, let me use this analogy: imagine six people talking to you at the same time, at the same volume, saying the same thing. Which one are you going to pay attention to? With all of the hotel’s hotspots on the same frequency, doing the same thing, the airwaves become a garbled mess, and my laptop had a hard time staying connected. Noob move.</p>

<p>Overall, our first day was uneventful. We packed up and rested. The real fun begins on day two.</p>

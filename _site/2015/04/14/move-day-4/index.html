  <p>This was the day we were all waiting for. The day we drive into town, unload the truck, and start our lives in California. This was also the day I forgot how much I don’t like moving up and down stairs.</p>

<p>When I pulled in, I barely fit. The power steering was whining because I insisted on holding the wheel all the way to the right. The truck fit, and the trailer followed behind, by only by a hair. Mere inches were between my front bumper and the gate edge, and same with my trailer wheels. Someone didn’t think the entrance through enough.</p>

<p>Either way, I found a place to park the truck and get rid of the trailer so we could unload. It was warm, but not super hot… 60-something, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>It only took a few hours to unload the truck when we counted breaks. Having help was nice, especially when it came to conquering the three flights of stairs. Before dinner, we were done and the truck was back where it belonged.</p>

<p>So glad it’s over.</p>

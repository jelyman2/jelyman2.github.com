  <p>Yesterday I decided to shake things up a little but when it comes to my morning routine. By shake things up I mean go back to what I used to do that seemed to work so well. And by what I used to do I mean be creative.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about this struggle, before, but <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/03/moving-to-cali/">moving to California</a> ( <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-1/">and</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-2/">the</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-3/">effort</a> <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/04/move-day-4/">therein</a>) really <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/06/reset/">messed up</a> my <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/?s=routine">routine</a>. I’ve decided enough is enough and am slowly working my way back into the old swing. Yesterday, and every day before, I would get up at 8 or even sometimes 7 AM. That’s way too late in my book. My new goal is to return to my 5 AM rise time which will allow me to exercise my mind with tasks I enjoy before work.</p>

<p>With a cup of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/09/the-cold-brew-coffee-adventure/">my home made cold brew iced coffee</a> at my desk, today is day one of that goal. I didn’t make it at 5 AM, but I did get up early. I figure every day I can push a little bit harder.</p>

<p>So what inspired all this? A little site called <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com">My Morning Routine</a>. Every Wednesday a new individual is featured on the cover and they spend a few minutes talking about their morning routine and why it’s important to them. You can follow this up with <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com/statistics/">statistics</a> on each of the routines archived and the key points to take away.</p>

<p>For example: did you know the average bed time for their respondants is 11:14 PM? That seems so late to me, but in reality, it’s not. It really depends on what you’re doing at that time. If I wanted to wake up at 5 AM, that may be a bit late, but in my case, 9 PM may not be.</p>

<p>I also found it interesting that 68% of the people featured meditate or practice yoga in some fashion. This intrigues me because of <a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/2015/10/headspace/">my inital success with meditation</a>.</p>

<p>The stories give me some fuel to shape my own morning routine that I find to work best for me. I’ve added a bit of extra work on top from the sole fact that I’m starting this at the time of year in California when it’s dark until almost 8 AM.</p>

<p>Will it be hard? Probably, but the best things in life are the ones we have to work hardest for.</p>

<p>I look forward to documenting my progress and eventually looking back and wondering how I was able to get by with practically doing just the bare minimum to stay alive (or so it’ll likely seem).</p>

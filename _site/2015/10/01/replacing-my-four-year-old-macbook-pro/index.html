  <p>So it’s finally happening. After over four years—52 months to be exact—my Early-2011-era Macbook Pro is being retired. In its place is going a new Macbook Pro of the same size.</p>

<p>I spent quite a bit of time thinking about what would replace my daily workhorse. I’ve put this system through the ringer and it’s held up amazingly well. Through all the days I’ve toted it to an office to use instead of my work machine (lol Windows) and the number of times most other laptops would have given up the ghost, my Mac has held up. It’s seen a total of five versions of OS X, now, including the latest, El Capitan. I started with OS X Snow Leopard and rocked that for a few months.</p>

<p>I still vaguely remember what it was like to pay for operating system upgrades, although that memory is quickly fleeting. I used to think paying $30 for an upgrade was miles better than the high prices of Windows. Now, I think $30 is too much and am not sure what I would do if Apple started charging, again.</p>

<p>My new system arrives tomorrow courtesy of UPS and I’m looking forward to one thing more than faster this and that: the weight. I’ve gotten used to the near six pounds that my current Macbook Pro weighs, but the Mid-2015 model clocks in at 4.5. It might not seem that much lighter, but tied in with the size difference, it adds up.</p>

<p>Most of all, though, I’m looking forward to the external monitor support. The unit I purchased only has integrated graphics but those integraphics (new word) can drive two 4K monitors plus the built-in display at the same time. Talk about screen real estate. Sure it’s not going to hold up well for gaming, but I didn’t guy it for that.</p>

<p>Friday can’t come soon enough (tomorrow?). See you then! I’m sure I’ll have things to share about my new, fancy laptop this weekend.</p>

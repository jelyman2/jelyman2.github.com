  <p>I never thought I’d end up being a fan of the Elder Scrolls franchise. I haven’t so much as played any of the past titles including the ever popular Skyrim.</p>

<p>Then last weekend, while I was scrolling through the PlayStation Store on my PlayStation 4, I came across Elder Scrolls Online: Tamirel Unlimited. I was naturally a bit curious as I hadn’t followed the franchise much and wanted to know more about this unknown-to-me installment.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it wasn’t a new installment at all so much as it was an all-access pass to the Elder Scrolls Online world. Previously, people had to pay monthly for the game like those who play World of Warcraft and MMOs like it. Having a one-time fee of $60 seemed much more appealing to someone like me that might pick it up and put it down here and there and go a significant while without playing.</p>

<p>The last thing I wanted to do at this point in my gaming career (if you can call it that) was to end up spending $15-20 a month on a game that I only play for a few hours a week. The total cost of ownership would be much lower at this single price point, even at the same duration of play per month.</p>

<p>So I caved and bought it. Since it was a digital purchase, I more or less bought rights to play it, but that’s just semantics. I really thought I would be able to pick it up and start playing that same night. As it turns out, that wasn’t quite the case.</p>

<p>At almost 36GB for the main game and 18GB for the “update” to said game, I was in for a wait. A 55GB game is nothing to sneeze and and that gave me hope there would be a lot of content and a lot of places to explore.</p>

<p>The next day, long after it downloaded, I fired it up and jumped into the fray. This comes after spending a few hours the night before watching YouTube videos to partly learn about what’s going on and partly secretly justify my (probably) non-refundable purchase.</p>

<p>First impressions are important, and I wasn’t really disappointed. The visuals are on par with what I would expect from a current-generation game console at steady frame rates. The story is as fantasy as it can get. The interface took some getting used to as this is my first foray into the console-MMO space. Quest markers were the hardest parts to get down.</p>

<p>After several hours, I was hooked, however, and am glad I made the purchase. So far, I’ve sunk roughly 10 hours into the game and have just scratched the surface. I look forward to continuing my digital adventures with my character named NathanielIronbow. Cheesy, I know.</p>

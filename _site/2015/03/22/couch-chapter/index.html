  <p>Two weeks from the day I write this, we’ll be on the road headed south. If I have my way, we’ll be at our half-way point and relaxing into the evening.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s two weeks from now. In present day, I’m sitting here with a mostly empty home.</p>

<p>One of the things we decided to do was sell most of our furniture to a) make room for new stuff, b) get better fuel economy, and c) make a few extra bucks by giving furniture to people who need it.</p>

<p>It’s been harder than I thought in terms of parting with items that have essentially been with us since the beginning. We sold what really was our first couch, a couch donated to us by my wife’s parents. It wasn’t anything special, but it helped us out immensely and it became a staple in our living room for the next three years. </p>

<p>Fast forward to now, and we sold it last week on Craigslist for a very small fee. I don’t know what it was off the top of my head but I feel like it was somewhere around $50. That’s not a lot, and we weren’t expecting to sell it for a lot, because it’s a simple couch and wasn’t new by any means. </p>

<p>What’s important to tell about this story isn’t that we sold a couch for chump change compared to a new one, it’s to whom it was sold. </p>

<p>The buyers of our starter couch were a young couple, like us. They were moving to a new home and didn’t have any furniture to start. For this story, I’m assuming it’s their first solo space together, given their age. They looked like they were in their early 20s, maybe 22. While I’m only a few years older, I can remember what it felt like just a few years ago to try to scrape together enough to buy furniture.</p>

<p>This wonderful young couple also nabbed a couple night stands from us, too, for their new space. We helped them load the furniture and sent them on their way. I’m sure they’ll be able to put the couch to good use, just like we did. If they only have it for a year, it’ll have served its purpose. Perhaps they’ll sell it to someone else who will be in need, too, and it can continue on its journey providing butt comfort for new home owners.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only story I have about people who’ve come and obtained furniture from us. A lady came by today to pick up our coffee table. Her and her partner are moving into a larger space from a tiny Seattle urban apartment. </p>

<p>Another person bought our bed frame and dresser from us. He was recovering from breaking up with his girlfriend of a long time (I want to say seven years). She wanted to get married, and he wasn’t ready for such commitments. (Yes, I know seven years is a long time to be with someone and what’s marriage at that point, right? I don’t know what to tell you, here. I wasn’t there to ask the guy questions)</p>

<p>At the time I write this, there’s only two pieces left: the entertainment center that houses my networking gear, the Playstation 4, and the TV as well as the desk at which I sit to write this post. It’ll be hardest for me to get rid of this desk because I enjoy my daily ritual of writing. It’s what I usually do in the morning to keep stimulated.</p>

<p>I know things are going to be a bit crazy for a few weeks and I’ve already come to terms with the idea that I won’t be writing as much. I guess I could still sit at our dining room table. That’s the one piece of hard furniture that isn’t from IKEA and solid wood. We just bought it and I like it. I’m putting my foot down there. Sure I could put my foot down at my desk, but I could go for a simpler space, too. I don’t need drawers. Just a flat surface to put my laptop down on, maybe room for a notepad to write on, and my basic pull-cord lamp, powered by the one LED lightbulb we own.</p>

<p>It’s honestly been rough coming to the realization that we’re moving soon. I’ve lived her my whole life and in two weeks we start fresh somewhere totally new for both of us. What’s made it easier to swallow is seeing our stuff go to good homes where people need it. Our dump run will be minimal and we already made a Goodwill run, today, where other stuff of ours will find a home and be used by someone, somewhere. </p>

<p>One thing about life is that things always change and change can be scary but it can also be good.</p>

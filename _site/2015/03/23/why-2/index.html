  <h1 class="post-title">Why This Site</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-03-23T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">23 Mar 2015</time>
  <p>I’ve kept this site going with mostly daily content for the last few months now, and I’m quite impressed with how far it’s come. It’s no money maker, for sure. It likely never will be. At some point, this address won’t even point to a blog, but a more professional presentation of me. This blog will be delegated to its own address with its own name.</p>

<p>But that’s a project for another time. Right now, I want to reflect on why I do this.</p>

<p>I don’t blog because all the cool kids are doing it. I don’t blog because it’s my job. I don’t blog because I have something I want the entire world to hear or read. I blog because I can. Plain and simple. I do it because have thoughts and things I want to talk about to whomever will listen and this is the best way to do that without annoying the hell out of someone.</p>

<p>I blog because it’s the right thing to do. I could keep all my thoughts and words to myself, but what’s the fun in that? What’s the point? The truth of the matter is, you’re not protecting yourself from anyone by doing that.</p>

<p>I also don’t care if my thoughts don’t elicit the proper responses. I’m telling a story, explaining something, or just flat out offering my opinion. Whether people like it or not is up to them and at the end of the day, all I’m doing is blogging… because I can.</p>

<p>I set up this site originally as a portal for just that. After having jlyman.net for a couple years and not really doing anything with it, I decided it would make for a good home for this project. Coincidentally, having this site has also kept my mind fresh regarding self-hosting a site and all that goes into it.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’d have the same attachment to it if I used a managed service. I think that gives me an advantage regarding staying the course.</p>

<p>That and I have lots to say.</p>

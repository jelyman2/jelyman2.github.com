  <p>end game (n.) – the late or final stages of any activity.Thinking about what my goal for this blog is made me realize: I don’t have one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m ok with that. There’s something to be said about just wanting to do something because you can. I don’t play video games because at one point I’ll end up being a professional gamer and spending my life playing League of Legends for money. I don’t blog because one day I want to make this site a full time job earning money.</p>

<p>At least not right now.</p>

<p>There’s always the same thought that crosses my mind every once in a while regarding the slim possibility this site ever becomes famous or even just a smidgen popular. I have plans for my blog but none of them involve some masterful end goal.</p>

<p>As time progresses, things change. When traffic increases, perhaps it’ll be time to focus on specific topics or themes. Right now, I ramble most of the time and post generic stuff. Sometimes there’s a theme, sometimes not.</p>

<p>I know people read this but I also know more people would read it if they found it interesting to them.</p>

<p>Right now though,t it doesn’t really matter. I write because I can, because I want to. I write because it frankly feels good to me. Some people knit, some paint. Writing makes me feel like I accomplished something.</p>

<p>As long as I can continue to do just that, I don’t need an end goal. And end is an exit. I don’t want to exit from writing.</p>

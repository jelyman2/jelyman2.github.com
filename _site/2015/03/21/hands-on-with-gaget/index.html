  <time datetime="2015-03-21T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">21 Mar 2015</time>
  <p>Recently I wrote a <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/gaget">couple blurbs</a> about an iOS app and OS X notification widget called <a href="http://gagetapp.com/">GAget</a>. I received the opportunity to get some hands-on time with it and now I’m ready to share with you my experiences.</p>

<h2 id="ios-app">iOS App</h2>
<p>First let’s start with the iOS version, simply because I have my phone in front of me. When I first wrote about GAget, I had an iPhone 5. Now I have an iPhone 6. The app isn’t optimized for the iPhone 6 and 6+ but no matter as it still looks pretty dang good. </p>

<p>Setting up the app is dead simple. You’re asked to go in to a Google account (ideally one that has access to Google Analytics) to get started. You’re taken to a Google sign in page where you’re instructed to enter your credentials. If you have two-step authentication enabled on your account like I do, you’ll have to take care of that, as well.</p>

<p>Upon verifying your credentials and accepting the app’s request to view your <a href="https://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> data, you’re taken to a wonderful home screen.  All the essentials you need to keep track of visitor history is right there. This app isn’t for those who want to have super granular campaign data or do whatever they do with behavior tracking. That’s not what this app is about. GAget is for those who want the basics and they want it without fuss.</p>

<p>You’re presented with a line graph of historical data regarding visitors, and are shown the most recent entry, which should be the same day. As you scroll down, you get to see things like overall stats for the last two weeks including visits, unique visitors, and total page views among said visits.</p>

<p>Next is you’re given some nice circle-based metrics (a.k.a. a pie chart) showing more visit and exit percentages. Follow that up with some averages and a detailed traffic breakdown and you’re on your way! Need a refresh? just shake.</p>

<p>The app is lightweight, super smooth, and supposedly comes with the ability to use your site as a background. I was unable to get this to work, however, but I imagine it looks good, too. </p>

<p>GAget will allow you to view multiple sites, if you have more than one present in Google Analytics. All you need to do is swipe left and right to move through them!</p>

<h2 id="os-x-widget">OS X Widget</h2>
<p>The widget that sits in the OS X notification center functions a lot like the iOS app in that it shows you a lot of the same information, only if you request it. The widget sits in the Today section and by default only shows you your visits for the day, but when clicked, expands to show recent history, as well. It doesn’t have the same granularity in terms of sources of traffic but everything else seems to be present. </p>

<p>The widget is really meant for a quick glance at the action taking place on your site and how many millions of people you have coming to see your wares. It’s ok if you don’t have millions. It don’t, and it works for me, too.</p>

<p>Both the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget/id716442061">iOS app</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget-simple-widget-for-google/id968487158?mt=12">OS X widget</a> are priced well, at $1.99 and $2.99 each. The iOS doesn’t have a free option nor does it have any kind of ads present, so it’s really one of those pay-once-enjoy-forever deals that I personally really like. </p>

<p>I’ve spent a week with both versions  and I like each in its own way. They make glancing at your data easy and painless and for the price, you really can’t go wrong with that much more convenience. For the price of a cup of coffee, you can have both apps. For the price of a vending machine snack, you can have your Google Analytics data in your phone without the fuss.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I received an email from the App developer and clarified a couple points in the article.</p>

  <p>I caught an article this morning from <a href="http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a32668/invisible-girlfriend-experiment/">Esquire</a> talking about the writer’s experiences with <a href="http://invisiblegirlfriend.com">InvisibleGirlfriend.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter what I asked, Zoe always had a logical response. If she didn’t, she expertly skirted the question. Sometimes her texts were ominous, sometimes oddly detailed. She was always in a good mood. She didn’t mind if I ignored her for hours, though she always responded to me within minutes. She never texted first. If I didn’t initiate that day’s conversation, we simply didn’t talk.LOL… <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I kept reading the article and came to an odd conclusion: there really is something out there for everyone. At the same time, I became a little sad. The somethings out there for “everyone” include people behind a wall getting paid per text to have small talk with someone. Ten bucks says Zoe, the woman the author highlights in the article, looks nothing like her picture.</p>

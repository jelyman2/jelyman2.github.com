  <p>Music is one of those things: you either like it or you’re weird. Music for me is a way to eliminate the distractions surrounding me and enter the world the artist as created. Any genre of music can work. If it’s Taylor Swift, that world exists just as much as Vivaldi’s. As I write this, I’m actually just sitting back in my chair with my eyes closed. It’s good that I can type without looking (there’s always spell check, too).</p>

<p>Music is a gateway to your imagination. It stimulates your brain into opening up your creativity and letting flower new ideas and at the same time lets our hone in on existing ones. For some, music is purely claiming. For others it gets them amped up. I’m sure the type of music has something to do with that, no doubt. </p>

<p>When I get started early in the morning, Spotify gets started with me. If you’re not using Spotify or another service like it to get your music, you’re missing out. As buying CDs is dying, buying singles from iTunes or similar is dying. I pay the equivalent of two trips to Starbucks every month for unlimited music in all categories, for whatever listening events I desire. It’s the best $10 I’ve ever spent to help me focus. Now how do I return these brain drugs I bought off the TV?</p>

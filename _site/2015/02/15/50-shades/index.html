  <p>I tried a lot of different titles for this post, starting the moment I left the theater last night. This one seems to fit the best.</p>

<p>Heads up: if you haven’t read the books, my recounting the movie might spoil something for you. There’s nothing in the movie that wasn’t in the book so don’t freak out. Keep your pants on. No one needs to see that. Also, I’ll probably end up ranting by the end of this. </p>

<p>My wife is a fan of the books, and I don’t blame her. She likes to read that sort of thing, just like millions of other women. I don’t fault her for that, and I never will. It became an adult fiction sensation of sorts and eventually a movie. </p>

<p>I’ve never read the books, and if I had a plan to read them before, I certainly don’t now. I saw the movie last night on Valentine’s Day because my wife thought it would be romantic and fun. Me being the cynic I am, scoffed at the idea but since I like to support my wife in her decisions and ideas, I opted to go without making too much of a fuss—I did make a lot of jokes about ‘butt stuff’ on our way to the theater, though, because I can be rather immature at times and jokes about ‘butt stuff’ is funny in this context.</p>

<p>The line to get into the theater was long, but not Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings long. It was composed of two groups of people: women with their women friends who are excited to see Jamie Dornan naked doing sexy things, and couples where the woman likely brought the man so she could see Jamie Dornan naked doing sexy things in hopes he’ll think said sexy things are worth attempting back at home.</p>

<p>This is my first exposure to the actual story of Christian Grey beyond anecdotes my wife shared with me in the last couple of years while she read the books. I frankly didn’t remember anything about him other than that he liked butt stuff and was an asshole. To have a movie surrounding that? Whew, I’m excited…</p>

<p>Dakota Johnson’s character, Anastasia Steele turned out exactly how I thought she would. Nothing fits the whole storyline of an inexperienced woman meeting a man who knows all sorts of kinky moves like a woman who’s never been with a man, period. Might as well go all the way, I guess. Johnson and Dornan are good looking people and fit the roles well up to that point. Johnson’s character is too awkward to not be noticed in the way that fingernails can’t be ignored on a chalkboard, and Dornan sucks at being an American. Plus, anyone with the last name of Steele, according to every other romance novel in existence should be better prepared for just about anything. Did anyone notice the dynamic between the names Grey and Steele? Let that sink in for a minute. Yes. The author lacks that much creativity. Moving on.</p>

<p>The film opens up exactly like you would expect. A 20-something girl just trying to get by, doing that whole homebody thing with not much time for men as she just tries to get by in school and at her ‘meh’ job at a place in which she has no interest. The all of a sudden a magnificent piece of chiseled man enters her life because why the hell not. Add a dash of awkward, another cup of awkward, and a pinch of bad writing, and you have the opening scenes of the movie.</p>

<p>As we move throughout the movie, I notice particulars about Seattle that the filmmakers would hope no one would notice. First, North Seattle is not 90 miles away from Seattle and it’s definitely not called Portland. Yes. They think that little of you. The scene involving Ana entering the freeway on her journey to Seattle to interview Grey was shot ten miles north of Seattle. Conveniently it was the exact same place where I saw this movie—the theater was in the background. Somehow they figured out how to bend space-time since 90 miles opened up between what us Seattle people call Northgate and downtown Seattle. While I’m enjoying pointing out how wrong that scene was, let me point out: there is a hell of a lot more than 90 miles between Portland and Seattle. Let’s try 170, depending on where you’re coming and going. Way to go, guys. You didn’t even try. A lot of the other scenes in the movie are in real locations, and points to whomever did the areal footage while we had our Seahawks flag up on the Space Needle. </p>

<p>As a man, this movie frustrated me quite a bit, not because there was a better looking man on the screen doing weird shit with a girl who’s never had sex in her life, but because he’s a pompous asshole. I wanted to title this post “50 Shades of Pompus Asshole” but that was too narrow. The story basically boiled down to a guy with mommy issues who was basically beaten by an adult woman friend as a minor. Never mind the fact that Johnson’s character reacts none to the fact that he was underage and where BSDM starts, sex finishes, especially in this movie. If he was re-living his dominant-submissive experiences on the dominant side this time, he was definitely raped statutorily for many years. That’s anecdotal though, right? No one really cares about that. Right?</p>

<p>Whatever. Pushing that aside, too, we’re still left with a sliver of a relationship dynamic. During “contract negotiations” he offers her one date night a week. Well, Mr. Pompus Asshole, thanks so much for allowing her to have a shred of kindness from you beyond superficial shit you buy her every week. It’s so nice that you’re willing to come down off your massive ivory entitlement tower and be a real human. </p>

<p>Throughout this whole movie, I honestly wanted to tell him to go fuck himself. The acting was bad, but that’s not a big deal. Acting is bad is a lot of romantic drama comedies. I hated his character and not in a good way. When the movie entered the final scene, I hated his character, but I hated E. L. James and the director this bucket of crap we call a movie even more. To think that it would be some woman’s fantasy to be downright assaulted to tears and that it’s a good thing is selfish, disgusting, and downright fucked up. After the movie ended, I realized one thing. The books were written by a woman who has issues. She probably enjoys all of this shit and what better way to live it out but in a book and eventually a movie? Who wouldn’t like to see their fantasies played out like that? People have been saying that there’s nothing wrong with a woman putting her fantasies on paper, and normally I would agree with that statement. This time, however, I can’t believe that a woman would only want a man to beat her, shove shit up her butt and vagina, and be OK with zero emotional contact. It all reeks of unresolved issues from both parties. </p>

<p>I couldn’t help but wonder if I’m just over-reacting and not taking the movie-book smack fest at face value, so I turned to two sites that would either confirm my suspicions that I’m not the only one who feels this way or demonstrate that I’m turning into an old man and should just say home and let the kids do their kinky shit. Fandango.com was a waste of time. The reviews there were basically fangirls freaking out that there were people out there who think it’s all a pile of shit and padding the ratings to defend whatever fucked up love story they think the first 50 Shades of Grey resembled. IMDB.com told a much different story. Where Fandango had 15,000-something “reviews” with 4/5 on average, IMDB had 393,000-something people who marked it at an average 3.2/10. Granted one does not have to write a review to rate a movie and it’s pretty easy to pad the ratings on IMDB, but the reviews (only 400 or so) told a more accurate story. It was hard to find someone who saw the movie and actually liked it. There weren’t any screaming fangirls, here. No one shouting “I want Grey’s babies” or anything of the sort. Just people saying abuse is not romance and this movie shouldn’t be treated as anything remotely romantic. At least I’m not alone in thinking that.</p>

<p>After the movie ended, I asked my wife if it gets better. She tells me things get much better in the 2nd and 3rd books, and they end up getting married. That’s great. We could have boiled down those three books into one movie, though. No need for three. Man has problems, meets girl, girl tries to fix him, girl fixes him, they get married. The end. I pretty much described every romantic dramedy. </p>

<p>It’s also easy for me to sit here and basically hate on this movie, the books, and E. L. James. And if you were to tell me that to my face, you’d be right. It’s super easy, thank to the Internet. But as someone who came into the whole scene without any prior information or knowledge about what happens in the story, it’s also super easy for me to make an unbiased judgement about the story, the premise, the characters, and make hypotheses about what’s going through E. L. James’ head. My opinion is just that, mine, and I’m sure there’s a whole host of people out there—mostly women, I’m sure—who’d think I’m just another dick who just doesn’t understand that all Steele wants is to make him love because she loves him. Sorry to break your world of fantasy, but I figured that one out on my own, already. See the last couple of paragraphs.</p>

<p>All in all, this movie could be worse. The acting was meh, the art direction was pretty good, and it was in Seattle. The characters are good looking, sure, but I’m sure the extent of male satisfaction was just to see Dakota Johnson take it from behind. I can’t even try to describe what women are seeing in this whole thing. I get the teasing and foreplay, but the pain and beating just seems odd and unresolved-issue laden. I may never know, and that’s fine. For the sake of supporting my wife, I may go see the 2nd and 3rd movies, if they ever actually hit theaters (or go straight to disc, like all paltry sequels) and hope to God that Grey stops being such a dick. I’ve never wanted to reach through the screen and blow someone’s brains out all over their marble floors like I did with him… I know what happens, but as it stands right now, I hate him (and people like him). </p>

  <p>The easiest way out of a difficult situation in life is to give up or pull the pin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0087TUM54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0087TUM54&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=BNM2PMM3XHDP636W">Pressfield</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term “pulling the pin” comes from the old days of riding the rails. To uncouple one car from another, the train crew pulled a heavy steel pin out of the coupling mechanism.When someone pulls the pin in a metaphorical sense, they’re giving up, they’re quitting. I’ve been in situations where I wanted to give up so bad. There were times that I did, too! Hell, I’ve given up a lot in my life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes when I gave up, it was because I made a made decision in the first place. Sometimes, it was because I didn’t give a rat’s ass, and sometimes, I was bailing.</p>

<p>No one is immune to giving up because it’s easier. Looking back on things I gave up on, if I stuck with them, I could be in a different place than I am today. Instead, I have to live with my choices, and those choices ultimately gave me the great things I have today… with a bunch of additional hard work.</p>

<p>I can speculate that I might not have the job I have today, I might not have the wife I have today, and I might not be living where I am today. Who really knows? If I hadn’t given up high school, I could have gone to a good college and had a degree in something I enjoy several years ago. Looking at my age, I would also likely have a master’s degree, all before I turned 26.</p>

<p>I pulled the pin and paid the consequences for it. I failed out of high school and had to start over in order to graduate. I had to work jobs that didn’t require much education in order to make a living. I led a shadow life not doing what I really wanted to do because I fucked up. Even during this shadow period, I never pulled the pin, and it’s paying off.</p>

<p>Would I go back and do it differently? Hell yeah I would, so long as I can pick and choose what happens. Unfortunately, that’s not how life works, so without that control, I absolutely wouldn’t go back.</p>

<p>The next time you think about pilling the pin or giving up, think about what’ll happen next. Think about more than just your feelings at that moment. Stop being selfish. I was selfish and only cared about my laziness. I cared only about how easy the easy way out was. Life isn’t easy. To think it is, is amateurish in nature and a guaranteed way to fail.</p>

<p>I’ve seen what it’s like to not give up.</p>

<p>I’m not a fucking quitter. Fuck pulling pins.</p>

  <p>I don’t play many videos games at the same time for one reason: I don’t have time. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy playing video games as much as the next mid-20s male. When I do have time to play a game, it has to be some thing I really want to play and play actively.</p>

<p>This is where I picked up Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. This is one of those games where I looked at it for some time and never bit the bullet but then one day my wife gifts it to me.</p>

<p>I started playing it yesterday, and am playing it as I write this and one thing jumped out right away: it’s hard.</p>

<p>And by hard I mean: I died a lot. The game itself isn’t very hard. It’s actually about on par with what I would expect for this style of gameplay. The problem lies from the idea that one can fire up the game and start slaughtering the world around them, and that’s definitely not true. The missions are in place for a reason: complete them. If you don’t, you’ll likely be missing out on some cool powers and upgrades that’ll keep you from dying so much later on.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MiddleEarthShadowofMordorFirst30MinutesGameplay-42.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once I realized that, I started mastering the art of slaughtering orcs and boy is it fun. As the story progresses, you start climbing the ranks of orcs and knocking them down, one by one. Don’t lose to them too often, though, as they’ll become more powerful and bring more friends with them, making them hard to beat.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ejrbrg5ciei5kyolvltw2.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you set your sights on a target, you want to do everything you can to take them down right way. Don’t half-ass your assassination attempt and be really good at countering attacks. They’ll knock you down and put you on your back in no time and before you know, you’ll be respawning. Learn each captain’s vulnerabilities, it’ll make life much easier for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shadow-mordor-review-12.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Beyond that, have fun. I really enjoy the game now that I know how to play it. Because I know how to play it, it’ll take longer to finish and grant me more reward for completing the smaller things, giving me that ever so needed satisfaction of progression and completion.</p>

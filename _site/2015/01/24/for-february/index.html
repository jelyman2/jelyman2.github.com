  <p>I missed writing yesterday, for the first time in almost three weeks but I had good reason. I was testing out an alarm clock app on my iPhone that plays gentle sounds that are supposed to gradually wake you. I thought this would be a great idea as I’m all about waking up to something less than an apocalypse coming from a bedside table. I promise this is going somewhere and is related to what I eventually want to talk about.</p>

<p>The first night I tried this app, it didn’t work. Turns out, it’s useless when you blatantly lock the phone. The notifications it throws are also useless in alerting you that it’s time to wake if you use the night-time privacy setting, like I do. After the first morning, all I got were a bunch of notifications that meant nothing to me anymore and was instead awoken by my wife, who just happened to be awake at the time.</p>

<p>The second night, I did a bit of poking around and found out that an app cannot play sounds while the phone is locked without user intervention. This is why I can play music and sounds all day so long as I tap a play button but an alarm clock app cannot automatically start making music. The workaround for my new alarm clock app friend is to leave the screen open, don’t let it lock, and just darken it after X minutes passes. That’s all find and dandy. The first few minutes the screen was on didn’t bother me as the screen was technically pretty dark to begin with; the UI elements weren’t bright at all, likely by design for night usage.</p>

<p>Come morning, however, this is where I realized I need a bit more push than gentle sounds to wake me up. I set my alarm for 3:30am to start making noise and work its way through sounds that get louder and more abrasive. Turns out, that did very little. It took two hours for me to notice my alarm was going off, a.k.a. 5:30am. Most days, I would be walking out the door at that point. With a small change of plans, I started rushing through my morning and I started remembering exactly why I get up earlier. Having the extra time to spin up every morning is much nicer and feels much better than getting more sleep. I’d trade an hour and a half of sleep for an hour and a half of time I can be productive, any day, so long as it’s in the morning. I’m not so much a fan of staying up late at night because by around 8pm, I’m pretty tired and staying up later doesn’t yield much productivity.</p>

<p>So anyway, back to my original topic of discussion. Because I missed my alarm, that was apparently going off for two hours like it was no big deal, I missed a writing session. I would have been writing from 4:15 to 5:15 or so and my creative juices would have been flowing. I told myself it was going to be all right and I was still meeting <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart" title="Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year">my goals for writing</a> something substantial at least twice a week. However, it got me thinking about expanding that idea and having two substantial posts and a few more minor posts talking about smaller topics. Here’s where we get into plans for February.</p>

<p>To say I don’t write enough isn’t quite accurate. I think at this point in time, based on recent history—three weeks—I’m writing plenty, that’s not the modification to my goal. What I want to start enforcing with myself is that I write every day of the week, no matter what and no matter how short or long the posts are, so long as I have two substantial posts per week. This plays on my old goals and gives me something to fill in for the remaining days of the week. I was thinking to myself just this morning that I could skip writing today because I’m still meeting my goals, but I really don’t want to skip writing. I enjoy writing. I enjoy telling a story about something that happened to me. I like sharing an experience. I like giving a tutorial or sharing instructions.</p>

<p>So be it. Every day, I’m writing more. March, I’ll up the ante, again in a small way—so as to not over-burden myself and end up quitting—and so on. Starting with February, I’m sticking to a daily writing routine with two days of substantial content and five days of shorter topics, minimum. I won’t stop myself from putting down three thousand words on a subject if I feel like it, I just won’t require it (yet).</p>

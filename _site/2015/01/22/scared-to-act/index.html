  <p>This one will be short, today. My wife and I are seeing changes blowing in the wind and the storm is certainly on its way. We’re moving to the great, sunny, state of California, more specifically, to the Bay Area. We’re excited and scared at the same time. From my point of view, my career will be taking a left turn into something greater, for sure, but that means more pressure to perform from me. On the flip side, I can also better my skills as a photographer, there, too, with all sorts of new locations and opportunities to grow.</p>

<p>It’s a difficult thing to pick up and move roughly a thousand miles away from where you grew up, but I know it’s worth it. The worst thing either of us could do is be too scared to act. I’d hate to see a potential opportunity for success be thrown away because we didn’t take the leap. Starting a new chapter in our lives is great. Starting it somewhere new for both of us is even better.</p>

  <time datetime="2015-01-31T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">31 Jan 2015</time>
  <p>There’s one thing I’ve always liked and that is super delicious tasty snacks. On top of that, there’s bonus points involved if said snacks are salty. Or sweet. Or anything.</p>

<p>I received what some would call a “care package” in the mail today from a company called NatureBox. See, <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;b=395413&amp;m=41415&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom">NatureBox</a> has this crazy idea that people really enjoy tasty snacks that won’t make you feel gross or regret eating them. I figured I’d give them a shot (I’ll help you do that, too, at the end of this article) and see what they’re all about. I used my ever amazing hookup powers to get a sampler box with four small snack pouches and one full-size bag of something mysterious.</p>

<p>Here’s what I had to think.</p>

<p>I placed my order with <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;b=395413&amp;m=41415&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom">NatureBox</a> on their site and within roughly a full calendar week, I had my box come in the mail. Remember what it was like when grandma sent her world-famous fruit cake to everyone when Christmas came around? Yeah, it’s nothing like that. NatureBox doesn’t do fruit cake, but they do mail stuff. The snacks come in a safe package that won’t let them get crushed or spoiled.</p>

<p>Each full size snack bag is re-sealable, too, which is nice. I’d hate to get some delicious food and at the end of the week have it go bad because I didn’t get to it in time.</p>

<p>A typical order is five bags of goodies from their selection of over 100. If you have a food allergy, their site will filter out what you’re not keen on consuming, including nuts, gluten, eggs, lactose, and soy. Ordering is super easy and only take a couple minutes, just long enough to pick out what you want from their menu.</p>

<p>If you’re too impatient, you can have them ship it out right away, instead of waiting around for your next monthly order to process. A five-snack box is $20 and you can go as high as 20 snacks for $50. Obviously, the more you get, the cheaper they are. If you have a large family or eat a lot of snacks, $50 can go a long way when a lot of the bags are rather hefty in size. The cranberry rice cake snack bag we received was four ounces and contained enough for four servings.</p>

<p>All of NatureBox’s snacks use only the best ingredients and they keep processed stuff out of their foods as much as possible. This means your sugars are pure cane and HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) is absent.</p>

<p>If I could justify ordering $50 worth of snacks in the mail every month, I would go for it. It’ll take a bit of time for my wife to be all right with that, so we’re sticking to the $20/five snack option. With that being said, if you’re not only interested in trying out NatureBox for yourself, but want to get $10 off your first order, <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=696279&amp;b=395413&amp;m=41415&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=naturebox%2Ecom">go to their site</a> and use the code <strong>share10off</strong>. When you tell your friends, tell them to use that code, too. They’ll appreciate it.</p>

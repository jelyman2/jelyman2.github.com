  <p>Because you’ll never be ready if all you’re doing it waiting until you’re ready. At some point, one needs to take a leap of faith. I’m not talking about religious faith. I’m talking about taking a chance on yourself and believing that you can succeed. There are new challenges almost every day in life, and while we try to be as world smart as we can and prepare for them as much as possible, sometimes things just don’t go according to plan.</p>

<p>This is something that I am working on myself, as I prepare for a life-changing move to California at the end of Spring. As someone who’s grown up and lived in the Seattle area my entire life, a move like this that involves a new, permanent location of living for at least ten years is frankly frightening. However, there isn’t an amount of preparation in the world that could prepare me 100% for something like this. I will never be 100% ready. I don’t have the data to support a hypothesis that if we move, zero bad things will happen. It’s easy to be cautious with that kind of idea, but that caution can also prevent me from continuing to do what I love and to support my wife and what she loves.</p>

  <p>I decided to start a project for the wrong reason. It’s because of this reason that I ended up giving up said project for the short term.</p>

<p>I thought I had it all figured out. I carved out time on my calendar, I made plans, I had an idea…</p>

<p>Turns out, the measurement for success in this project was grossly incorrect, and I realized it a couple days ago when I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936891034/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936891034&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=johnatlymanco-20&amp;linkId=SQZD7GW7YIX5GIY5">Steven Pressfield’s Turning Pro</a>. I never finished the book, so I felt it was appropriate to continue.</p>

<p>I came across this passage and it really hit home surrounding this project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real utility of money is its convenience as a medium of exchange. If you and I have a goat in Smyrna, we don’t have to carry the poor beast in our arms all the way to Aleppo to trade it for a carpet. We can sell the goat in Smyrna, stash a silver dairy in our pocket, then take the dairy to Aleppo to buy the carpet.But when we’re addicted to money, we become hooked on the metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is money how we keep score? Is it magic? Is wealth a currency that opens doors, realizes possibilities, produces transcendence?</p>

<p>– Turning Pro</p>

<p>In my case… it was.</p>

<p>I thought I could craft this project and end up getting rich quick. I’ve seen enough documentaries on how that’s never the case but yet I thought otherwise. When my project started, I got a huge influx of traffic to it and I thought it was going to be smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Then the traffic died off, and everyone left. Not a sole gave a damn. I was hoping they’d throw their digital selves at me in the form of coming back or contributing, but they didn’t.</p>

<p>I wanted to make money off this project. I wanted it to become a full-time thing. I didn’t think about the other battle I was waging that would ultimately affect this one.</p>

<p>Losing sight of what’s most important in any project is common and while sometimes it’s recoverable, other times, there’s no way to go but to the bitter end.</p>

<p>I canceled my subscriptions to all the things necessary to keep it running. It’ll die in a few days, and that’s OK by me. It shouldn’t have ever lived. I wasn’t ready for it and I made a Frankenstein.</p>

<p>Such is life.</p>

<p>Learning experiences can be tough sometimes, but when you’re keeping score for all the wrong reasons, it’s bound to happen… and it should. It keeps reality in play.</p>

<p>So instead, I’m focusing on what’s most important and fulfilling for me. I need to keep my head in as few places as possible, while still getting enough stimulation to keep myself fresh and mentally alive.</p>

<p>Too many outlets can lead to burn out, even if all said outlets are appealing. Sometimes, going back to the basics is exactly what the doctor ordered.</p>

  <p>I’m going to be honest: it’s been hard to keep up with blogging regularly.</p>

<p>It’s been nineteen days since I last posted something of meaning. This is unacceptable. I used to write every day. This was when my work schedule forced me to be up earlier in the morning so I added an hour onto it and started writing at 4am.</p>

<p>My current schedule shifted to later in the day with not needing to be at work for a couple more hours. This has put a damper on my morning blogging sessions.</p>

<p>After we moved, it became almost impossible to wake up early in the morning to write. I have yet to do it after almost two complete months. It’s quite disappointing, actually.</p>

<p>I averaged in 50-70,000 words a month back then. Sure they weren’t cohesive enough to be considered book worthy, but they added up to a book’s worth.</p>

<p>Here I am, under 200 words, and I’m frustrated. This is the first time I’ve personally blogged in June. By now, I would have had a good 400 posts. I averaged 2-4 per day on most days so it could have been even higher.</p>

<p>I need to get back to the core of why I started writing. I started my blog in the beginning of the year as an outlet. Sometimes my posts were long, sometimes they were short. Sometimes they inspired, sometimes people hated them. You can tell all that yourself by looking for the ones with comments.</p>

<p>Since it would seem that blogging every morning again is going to be a bit difficult, I’m going to shoot for it anyway. What’s the worst that could happen? I don’t have anything riding on this. No pressures of any kind. I don’t make money with this blog. I have yet to see a single dime from the words on this site, and that’s how I like it.</p>

<p>With a little help from my latest task management tool, 2Do, I’m going to start blogging every morning, again, including the weekends. This time, I’m not setting any rules. I created a bunch of parameters the last time I did this in January and they worked well because I blew right past them. This told me they didn’t serve any purpose.</p>

<p>I don’t have a goal parameter problem. I can write an essay’s worth of words in 30 minutes, for crying out loud.</p>

<p>I have a lazy-ass problem. I’ll admit it. Sometimes, I’m lazy as shit. I guarantee you my alarm will go off at 5:00AM tomorrow morning and I’ll tell myself it can wait a few hours.</p>

<p>But it can’t, because that’s how I ended up in this slump in the first place.</p>

<p>Here’s to resetting.</p>

<p>Let’s see how this goes!</p>

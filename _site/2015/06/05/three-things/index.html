  <h1 class="post-title">Three Things I Wish I Did Sooner</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-06-05T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">05 Jun 2015</time>
  <p>I could make this list a mile long, literally, but hindsight is always 20/20 and there’s a load of things we wish we could do differently. In this case, I’m paring this list down to three things that while I wish I would have done sooner, are not too late to start, now.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-code">Learn to Code</h2>
<p>This is one thing I wish I would have started a lot sooner, and is probably by far the highest on my list, and plays a lot into my other two wishes.</p>

<p>I entered the software development game much later than a lot of my peers who are already developers of various capacities. I didn’t get any formal programming experience until the end of 2013. I had an opportunity to transition into it full time and I should have taken it. Instead, I opted not to because I wasn’t thinking about my future.</p>

<p>I had a great job, that could have been even better had I paid attention. Instead, I lost it due to attrition and without a doubt I believe that had I chose door number one instead, I would have likely stayed on and worked there for some time.</p>

<p>Now, I’m basically starting from the beginning. I know how to write Python and I can understand just about any code I read, but I’m not a programmer. I wouldn’t mind being one, but I have yet to understand the fundamentals, even.</p>

<p>I started a free course from the University of Michigan via Coursera on Python and I hope this gives me some foundation on software development. I’m not ready to learn a massive language, yet. I need to master the basics, first, and Python is a great language (in my opinion) to do just that.</p>

<h2 id="consider-education-important">Consider Education Important</h2>
<p>When I was in high school, I didn’t give two shits about it, and if future me could have gone back and punched at-the-time current me in the face every time I was being stupid, I would have had a black eye on a weekly basis. Because I gave so little thought to my education at the time, I barely made it out in one piece.</p>

<p>I had the ability to go on to a great college and probably not have to pay for it. I could have done something awesome with my time. I figure I’d have a masters degree in something awesome I like and be doing something totally different, probably related to wish #1.</p>

<p>As much as people say college can be a waste of time and money, I firmly believe that if you point your energy in the right direction, and get a meaningful degree in something that can turn into a long-lasting career, then spend away.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m about six years behind the boat. I’m in college, now, but I wasn’t expecting it to take this long. Fortunately, with the advent of online programs, I’m working on a degree in something meaningful that I enjoy and am still able to have a life and a job, as well.</p>

<h2 id="spend-more-time-on-hobbies">Spend More Time on Hobbies</h2>
<p>I wish I had spent more time on hobbies that I found interesting in the last five or so years. I only have a few hobbies I really enjoy, but I only spent enough time on them for them to remain just interesting enough to partake in on an occasional basis. One of these hobbies is photography. I know that if I set my mind to it, I could do great things in that space, but even to this day I still fight with the idea of “I can do it later” and then boom you’re moving out of state and that giant list of places you wanted to photograph in Washington are now out of reach for a while.</p>

<p>So I have a big list of places in Washington State that I never got to photograph. It’s no one’s fault but mine. I’m physically capable of making all the necessary preparations and treks to those spots. I was just too lazy and sitting at home playing video games sounded fun at the time.</p>

<p>Now that everything has settled down here in California, this is something I’m devoting more time to. I really enjoy shooting and getting some time to enjoy nature, so now I have no excuses. I’m starting to plan out my adventures on my schedule and am going to stick to them just like I plan on sticking to everything else on the list.</p>

<p>——————————————-</p>

<p>In the end, though, there are a lot of things I would likely have to give up if my life had played out differently, and knowing what I know now about them, I can’t say I’d be okay with that. For starters, I probably would have never met my wife and she’s my best friend. I can’t say that I’d give her up for more programming experience, a larger photography portfolio or a higher grade point average in high school. Those things are all relative and while they have impacts on the future, their effects can still be corrected.</p>

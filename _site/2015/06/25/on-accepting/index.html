  <p>There’s a perpetual battle that takes place every day. This battle involves everything around you, your life, your hobbies, your friends, and your home.</p>

<p>This battle isn’t really a battle at all. It’s a dance. A tango, of sorts. We wake up in the morning and it’s time to dance. We lay our heads down at night and only after we close our eyes and drift into dreamland do we stop the motions.</p>

<p>From those words, it should be at least a step down from completely confusing what I’m referring to. If you’re not a mind-reader, or you haven’t skipped ahead, I don’t hold it against you.</p>

<p>What I’m talking about is satisfaction… being content with the things you have… the people you know… the amount of money you make.</p>

<p>Let me get this out there right now before I continue: I’m not saying you shouldn’t push for that raise or buy a new car to replace your current mode of transportation or anything of the sort. What I’m talking about is knowing when to gun for greatness and when to sit and be satisfied.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a story.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, a lot in my life has changed. The biggest change in my life was when I got married. My wife has been and will always be the biggest blessing to me. Beside her, there’ve been a host of other life changes (also known as obstacles) and there have been improvements.</p>

<p>Every so often, we move. This has been the case, historically, since 2011. So far as I can count, in the last four years, we’ve lived in five apartments of our own and one belonging to friends, including the one we live in, now. Each move has led us to a progressively better living situation, for the most part.</p>

<p>But there are times when we’ve taken lateral steps and most currently, we took a half-step backward.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about downgrading to living with other people or on the street or having to move back home. We picked a less-than-ideal neighborhood.</p>

<p>We had good reason, however. It was April, myy wife was slated to start graduate school at the end of the summer, our existing lease was set to end at the end of May, and I received a job offer that required us to move sooner rather than later, with later being the end of May.</p>

<p>We only had a few weeks to find a place to live. The money wasn’t unlimited so we couldn’t take our sweet time. Based on information we found online (apartment hunting), we found a place that looked decent. We had no idea what the neighborhood would be like because we had never been there before and were pretty new to the Bay Area in general. Our last visit was almost an indirect one as we played tourists and visited Golden Gate Park.</p>

<p>After we move in, we come to find that perhaps our decision was a bit rushed, but it was too late to do anything about it, now. We were already there. We spent two days moving 900 miles and couldn’t return home. We also couldn’t shore up somewhere until we figured out a better living situation. We discovered our neighborhood wasn’t the best, as some would call Hayward, CA <em>Little Mexico</em>. Maybe they were right. I, for one, love Mexican food, so there’s no harm in that.</p>

<p>However it’s not the safest area, either. I’ll admit that the large gates and high walls around our apartment building signify more than just styling choices.</p>

<p>We have a little crime-free oasis. While it might not be ideal, it’s working out for us, right now, and we’re OK with that.</p>

<p>After all that, it all comes down to accepting what we have and learning to cope. Sure, we could move out, and we probably will at some point, but until that time comes, there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s time to suck it up and deal with our choices.</p>

<p>Do I regret the decision to move to the East Bay? No. Do I regret any of the decisions I’ve made in recent history? Absolutely not. Why? Because I’ve accepted them. I accepted the fact that I defaulted on a credit card one time, or I spent too much money on something I didn’t need. Fuck it. Life happens.</p>

<p>We all make mistakes and decide to travel the less than ideal path. However, when we’re faced with two decisions were neither are perfect, we suck it up and pick one. It’s the whole life-giving-you-lemons thing. We have a ton of lemonade to go around.</p>

<p>Don’t take my story as me saying I just gave up and decided that complacency is the best path to choose. That’s not at all the case. The path I code is one of more careful planning, better allocation of resources and making more informed decisions. I’m choosing to do take the slow road so I can spend the time to do it right.</p>

<p>So when it comes to making a life-changing decision, do you jump down off the roof onto the ground head first or feet first?</p>

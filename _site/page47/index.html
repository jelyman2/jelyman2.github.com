        Scared to Act

    <p>This one will be short, today. My wife and I are seeing changes blowing in the wind and the storm is certainly on its way. We’re moving to the great, sunny, state of California, more specifically, to the Bay Area. We’re excited and scared at the same time. From my point of view, my career will be taking a left turn into something greater, for sure, but that means more pressure to perform from me. On the flip side, I can also better my skills as a photographer, there, too, with all sorts of new locations and opportunities to grow.</p>

<p>It’s a difficult thing to pick up and move roughly a thousand miles away from where you grew up, but I know it’s worth it. The worst thing either of us could do is be too scared to act. I’d hate to see a potential opportunity for success be thrown away because we didn’t take the leap. Starting a new chapter in our lives is great. Starting it somewhere new for both of us is even better.</p>

        There Are Some Things Money Can&#8217;t Buy&#8211;For Everything Else, There&#8217;s a Cat in a Box.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-21T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>Sometimes I wonder about cats. Who invented them? Why are they here? Are those whiskers really just antennae they use to communicate with their alien space ships? All these things are valid questions if you are like me, because obviously my brain isn’t stimulated enough as it is. Of all cat-related questions out there, the one that keeps me the most interested and stumped is: what’s with the boxlust?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s a word I just came up with. Boxlust. Noun. The unreasonable and indescribable urge to be in, on, or around boxes as much as possible, for particular reason. I’ve witnessed my cat enjoy cardboard boxes like none other. Even as a kid, I enjoyed boxes, but not to the extent my feline friend does.</p>

<p>So that got me wondering: perhaps someone’s looked into this already! I look to the ever trusting Internet to find out the who, what, where, why, and how of cats and their desires for cardboard containers with eight right-angled corners.</p>

<p>The first thing I came up with was a quote from Stephen Zawistowski from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals (ASPCA). <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-do-cats-like-boxes-2013-6">He said</a> “Cats like boxes because they are cryptic animals; they like to hide…[it] gives them a place of safety and security.” That explains a lot. When my cat enters his corrugated fortress, I’ll find he’s dug a mote around his encampment and at some point in the day found alligators to fill it. I’m still trying to figure out where he was able to procure alligators, as I can’t even seem to procure the right kind of accessories for my Playstation 4 on Amazon.</p>

<p>Live Science <a href="http://www.livescience.com/45461-why-do-cats-like-boxes.html">tells us</a> that seeking out confined spaces is an instinctual behavior for cats. That makes sense, just like it’s an instinctual behavior for me to seek out a couch to veg on all weekend, every weekend. It’s a fire that burns deep in my core, and I suspect my cat lusts after the four-walled brown structure of an Amazon.com shipping box like a heroin addict lusts after crank: with the burning intensity of a thousand suns.</p>

<p>Although this all sounds like good information, I wasn’t satisfied with such normal and structured answers, so I took to reddit because why not? if the Internet has something to say about something, they’ll be saying it on reddit. Reddit User <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2fjma4/eli5_why_do_cats_like_boxes/ck9x5j7">OookOok says</a> it has something to do with trees, wood pulp, and the similarity. I’m trying to think of what wild cat fits <em>inside</em> a tree and can’t seem to come up with anything. Oh well, perhaps I’m missing a crucial demographic of the wild cat species: the one that’s like my house cat but somehow feral or wild? I didn’t know that was such a thing.</p>

<p>But then I got to thinking: in my obviously non-scientific accidental experiments, our cat seems to enjoy sitting on paper more than anything else. If my cat knew how to pay the child came “Hot Lava,” he’s a freaking expert. I feel like if my carpet ever became poisonous, he’d survive longer than I would. Perhaps he’s giving his <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2fjma4/eli5_why_do_cats_like_boxes/cka5hvk">kitty stamp of approval</a>?</p>

<p>Whatever the reason is, I find it incredibly amusing. I’ve given up on buying cat trees, beds, houses, or other expensive toys. He’s resorted to several $1 rattling mice, pens, and paper products. I really should see if Staples is selling cat toys now. I feel like they’d have a great new product line and niche covered in a heartbeat. Either that or just get him a job with UPS. All those boxes? Yeah, he’d dig that.</p>

        Extending My Writing Goals to Photography
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-20T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">20 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>When I’m not working, writing, or studying, I’m (ideally) shooting. I’m a <a href="http://jlymanphotography.net">landscape photographer</a> and by shooting I mean “taking photos of.” One of the things I struggled with in 2014 was my motivation to shoot more. I’ve always had a small inkling in the back of my mind that I’d like to live out a career at my desk writing and taking photos. With my start to writing underway (and so far going relatively smoothly), the next half of that is creating more photos.</p>

<p>A lot of photographers will tell you that the gear doesn’t make the photographer. While I find that to be true, the gear does make the photographer more motivated if the gear they just bought is exponentially better than what they used to own. See, up until the end of last year, I owned a four year old camera body—the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_60d">Canon 60D</a>—and a couple of lenses. Unfortunately, the 60D wasn’t the best for landscape photography for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor">Crop-Sensor</a>: While create for getting extra range when using a telephoto lens, the smaller sensor leads to more noise on the image because each individual pixel is much smaller. This became unbearable at a larger print sizes, which I love doing. I have a 30×20” photo in my dining room I took at Mt. Rainier that I would love to re-shoot with my new equipment. I know I’d get much better results.</p>

<p>2) Lens Selection: While I could pick out awesome, expensive glass, it wouldn’t be worth it. With a crop sensor body, I’d have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_factor">multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6</a>, which takes an amazing landscape photography lens such as the Canon 16-35mm and turns it into a 25.6-56mm lens. While that sounds nice, that’s a bit too narrow for me. So I settled with a 3rd-party brand lens that gave me 10-20mm of range, which equated to 16-36mm, exactly where I wanted, but with a trade-off. It wasn’t super sharp.</p>

<p>With those two elements combined, I had a setup that I didn’t really appreciate so I stopped using it a lot. When I had the opportunity to replace my gear, I jumped on the idea, and ordered a new body—the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_6d">Canon 6D</a>—and the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_16_35mm_f_4l_is_usm">Canon 16-35mm F/4 lens</a>. For what I want to shoot, it’s an amazing combination and so far I’ve had nothing but awesome luck and experiences with the combination. The setup is light and agile but not flimsy. The field of view is spectacular and the quality of imagery on the sharpness and clarity fronts are epic. Well worth the purchase.</p>

<p>For those who say that new gear won’t help you take better photos, they might be wrong if the old gear was of retiring age.</p>

<p>When it comes to actually taking photos, however, there’s no amount of gear that will make me get out and shoot. I have to want to. With the gear half of my desire out of the way, all I have left is myself to fight with. For 2015, I’m attempting to apply the <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/203/smart" title="Being S.M.A.R.T about Blogging Goals for the New Year">same goals I set up for my writing</a> to my photography and have broken them down as such:</p>

<p>1) Shoot at least twice a week</p>

<p>2) Different locations each time, not coming back for at least a month</p>

<p>3) Share at least one image from each shoot.</p>

<p>4) Stay at the location for as long as I deem necessary so as to not feel rushed.</p>

<p>5) Start taking my camera more places, intentionally, in case an opportunity appears.</p>

<p>These are rougher goals and guidelines than what I established for my wordsmith self, and that’s ok. I have a running list of places I want to shoot and each location requires different coordination in terms of time of day, weather, how long I’m there, how long it takes to get to my final destination, etc. I can’t reasonably expect it to take an hour to shoot at a beach at sunset and take the same amount of time while I hike two miles each way to a waterfall while raining. That’s unrealistic.</p>

<p>I think a lot of my shooting will end up on the weekends, as during the week, I am working a day job so my possible options will typically be limited to sunsets and night-time photography such as shooting the stars. I’m all right with that. I shoot over the weekend while I was in California and got some great photos. After work yesterday, I ran out and shot a sunset at the beach and got more great photos. I could have just as easily stayed home after work because I was certainly tired, but I knew that it wouldn’t take <em>that</em> long, and I really just need to do it and stop complaining.</p>

<p>If I ever want to make this something I do more regularly and possibly make money from, I need to work at it more. Same with writing. If I ever want to make something of it, I need to keep at it. No one becomes famous overnight (unless you go viral on the Internet, but even then that’s not really fame).</p>

        My First Smartphone
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-19T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">19 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>We all remember our first smartphones, for the most part. I know I remember my transition from the small brick phones that weighed as much as small bricks. They did the job back then. In 2003, texting was a limited thing still in my world and around all of my friends. We mostly emailed and instant-messaged each other. I think I did that pretty much all through high school. When I started using MySpace regularly, I communicated a lot through that service with my friends. Facebook, same story. It wasn’t until I bought my first smart phone in 2010 that my communication world really changed.</p>

<p>When I got my first flip phone, it was in 2007. I signed up with Verizon Wireless and felt super accomplished. I also had just turned 18 so I was allowed to sign up for stuff all by myself! I felt so accomplished. I even still remember my phone number from that time! I thoguht my phone was the coolest thing in the world. It had music playback capability, a front screen with music controls on it, I could browse the Internet with the built-in WAP browser… that was the life, for sure. Back then, battery life was awesome, too. I could go a couple days without charge while still using it regularly. I made a habit of plugging in nightly, though, as charging cables were still proprietary and good quality connectors were hard to come by.</p>

<p>My first flip phone was the LG Chocolate III. It was bigger than most flip phones of the time, and I loved that. It was shiny, had a great looking screen( for a flip phone) and the interface made it feel expensive. Since this was my first phone that had more than one color on the screen, I didn’t care about things like interface speed, lag, ux, or anything of the sort. It’s likely that a lot of people felt the same way. I rocked this phone for until my next upgrade date, which came 20 months later.</p>

<p>After I got my first taste of what adulthood brought in terms of mobile telephony, I wanted to kick it up a notch. The iPhone was still a really new thing and the iPhone 3G was out, but was an AT&amp;T exclusive. I didn’t want to switch nor did I have the money to shell out for a true smartphone (yet). I bought the LG Dare. With its 240x400px screen, I felt like I was living the high life. Bluetooth, HTML Web browsing, MP3 and AAC support… ahh the features! The Dare (VX9700) was my first entry into touch-screen space and I loved it.</p>

<p>Comparing the size to my current iPhone 5, the Dare was shorter (4.87 vs 4.1 inches), slightly narrower (2.31 vs 2.2 inches), and thicker (0.3 vs 0.5 inches). It’s amazing to think about how far display technology has come where you have a deivce like the Dare with 0.08mp of screen resolution at 152ppi over a three inch screen versus the iPhone 5’s 0.72mp screen at 326ppi over four inches. Talk about a jump in resolution!</p>

<p>When 2010 came, I finally landed my first real smart phone. By this time, the iPhone was still an AT&amp;T exclusive and I didn’t want to pay more money for the same measured service. I didn’t care about what one carrier had over the other. All I cared about was the fact that I would have to shell out more dollars for the same offering; that didn’t sound like a good investment, to me.</p>

<p>Instead of landing the iPhone, which wasn’t all bad as I wasn’t a fan of Apple products beyond the black iPod Nano I had at the time, I picked up the Motorola Droid X. When it arrived via FedEx, I was beyond excited. This was my first phone I could do complicated stuff with. It had a <em>real</em> browser, not some wimpy WAP-based turd. It had apps, too! The concept of Apps blew my mind and my views on my mobile device would never be the same. It had a huge—for its time—4.3” touch screen. With a 480×854 resolution, it was at the top of the smart phone display game, second to the iPhone, of course, which still had a higher density resolution screen.</p>

<p>At the time, though, I had no idea what that meant or why that would be significant to anybody. I was glad I had a device that was fast and had a big, beautiful display.</p>

<p>After about a year, though, I grew tired of this device. It made me feel that way, though, because at the time, Android aged quickly and updates to the software didn’t happen quick enough, if at all. The highest version one could install via traditional means was Gingerbread (2.3). It became clunky and slow and reminded me daily that it enjoyed gulping up battery juice. Even with larger capacity batteries, it didn’t take long before I got rid of it and switch to an iPhone.</p>

<p>After my battle with Android, I promised myself I wouldn’t buy another Android device, again. For the most part, I held fast to that promise. After I gave up my Droid X, my first <em>real</em> smart phone, I bought an iPhone 4S. I was thrilled to give it a shot after I heard so many good things about it from co-workers. I’ll admit it was a bit of a shock when I changed ecosystems. The whole premise was much different and I would grow to learn that was a good thing. This was my first realization that there are some devices I just want to work, no matter what. I don’t want to have to or even think about tinkering with some things, and my phone was the first on that list. It’s this idea that would eventually push me to replace my Windows PC that I hand built with a Mac.</p>

<p>Aside: to this day, I still get comments like “I’d never spend 2x on a closed platform” or “way to spend much more than any of that hardware is worth!” I like to casually remind people that unlike their Windows desktop or laptop, you’ll never hear me complaining about my mac being slow or crashing. To this day I’ve only hard rebooted my mac a couple times. As of this writing, I’ve never re-installed the OS, nor have I had to have it serviced for failing parts that don’t have a definite lifespan.</p>

<p>In 2013, I thought I’d give the Galaxy S4 a try, as I liked the idea of the large, bright, and colorful screen. Maybe that was my downfall, just as certain insects attract their prey with bright and beautfiful colors and or the allure of something great (read: black widow) only to kill them in the end because they made a stupid decision. The Galaxy S4 started killing me shortly after I got it. I was reminded of all the reasons why I disliked android: battery life, poor resource management, too many things that need tinkering to work right. I dumped it after just a few months and went back to an iPhone, where I sit to this day.</p>

<p>My next phone certainly won’t be an Android device. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? Nah. Perhaps I’ll pick up an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6S (or whatever the next version is that comes out this fall). All I know is that I bought android as my first smart phone because that was what I had available to me at the time. If I had been an AT&amp;T customer from the start, I may have never purchased an Android smartphone and had an iPhone from the beginning. If that was the case, I might have bought an Android device later on down the road anyway, and fought through the same battles, just in a different time frame. I can’t say for sure what would have happened, but I know that my first smart phone purchase helped shape my technology toolset as it stands now and my continued purchases will help mold my future decisions. Apple has done a good job of building up an ecosystem people don’t want to leave, and I’ll admit I am one of them. It’s comforting to know, however, that there are a lot of people like me who just want their stuff to work. If that means paying more, then so be it. Consider it a no-hassle tax.</p>

        And Then There Was One &#8211; Wrapping Up and Looking Back
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-14T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">14 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>So this is it. I signed on to the #10DaysBetterBlog challenge thinking I need to kick myself in the butt when it came to writing. I knew I wanted to do it, but I lacked motivation. I needed something that I could stick to, and work on in little pieces. Just telling myself “write more, ya dummy!” wasn’t cutting it. John Saddington’s 10 Days to a Better Blog has been the motivation I needed. I like to think of it as a personal workout regimen put together by a trainer. People <em>want</em> to get back into shape, but they having something there to motivate them and give them a place to start helps greatly. This was my personal training for writting.</p>

<p>But not just the action of putting words onto digital paper was affected, though. I re-started my blog. I decided to give a crap about sharing my ideas online. Sure I’ve written a couple things in the past. Back then, I kept telling myself that nobody wanted to read it so why bother? Over the last couple weeks, I learned something about that idea: it doesn’t matter how many people read it, it’s just the fact that you do it. I maybe have gotten three hundred unique sets of eyes over the last two weeks because of this challenge, and my posting links on the Desk.pm Community site. When it’s all over, I might not see any of those people again. Eleven days ago, things woudld have been different but now, I don’t care. I mean… I do care. I want to see people come to my site and read what I have to say. What I mean is that if I only get one set of eyes and those eyes belong to my wife or my mom or someone who reads my stuff in support of me, then that’s good enough. The number of eyes doesn’t effect my desire to write, anymore, and ideally it never will, again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I rambled a bit about where I want to go with my blogging, and set goals for myself a couple days ago. Looking back on the fact that I was able to write something and post it every day for ten days in a row is awesome. Taking the new found knoweldge I have on how much time it really doesn’t take to write something worthwhile and combining it with relfections of my goals and what I want to write about, the idea of keeping the train moving swiftly isn’t daunting. As I look back, I can say that two weeks ago me would have disagreed. I would have sighed at the idea of having to sit down and write every day, thinking that I’ll end up spending hours on something and have zero return. Nah. I get a boatload of returns each time and I don’t have to spend all day.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Completing this challenge/workshop has also helped my regular, daily routine. I discussed how I used to have a terrible morning ritual. It really wasn’t a ritual but more of a dazed panic, kind of like what happens right after you get out of your car after getting into a wreck and are losing your mind but you checked out at the same time? That’s how I used to feel every morning. That’s a terrible way to go to work and it leads to zero productivity. It used to take a couple hours to get my brain to spin up to full speed and waiting for that to happen made me even more tired. Now, I get up earlier, thanks to hacking my sleep schedule and making myself set aside time in the morning to do something stimulating like sitting down and writing. I used to think that getting up at 3:30-4:00am when I don’t have to leave until 5:30am was a joke. That’s a good 1 1/2-2 hours of sleep I could be getting. While that is <em>technically</em> true, it was more about when I wake up in my sleep cycle. Figuring that out and waking up more graually helped a lot more than sleeping in. I know this to be true because my weekends are still a bit sketchy. I still need to work on keeping my routine consistent on the weekends so my body can get used to it quicker. No hacks happen when you reset after five days, just to start over, again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It might be too late to create a new year’s resoltion but I don’t really care. I think the last couple weeks has been a long crafting process for my delayed new year’s resolution. Here’s to writing.</p>

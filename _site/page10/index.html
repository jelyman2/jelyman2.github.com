    <time datetime="2015-04-30T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">30 Apr 2015</time>
    <p>It’s not really surprising that Corinthian Colleges shut its doors. It’s also not surprising that there are students out there who are angry the schools are closing.</p>

<p>I see two things come from this event.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone with pitchforks who hate for-profit colleges want to see them all burn.</li>
  <li>Too many students are upset because they’re now without a completed degree, but don’t understand their degree probably wouldn’t land them a job in the first place.
When it comes to for-profit education, it’s easy to lump all schools together. However they’re not all alike. In the case of Corinthian Colleges, their “campuses” were really just large commercial/retail spaces that taught very specialized material. Everest College was strictly medial, and WyoTech was strickly mechanical. These schools did not provide general post-secondary education in high-demand fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can typically tell what the overall end-goal of a for-profit college is by what it offers students. In Corinthian’s case, they jumped on the bandwagon carrying people who sat at home watching day-time TV and collected unemployment checks. I know, I used to be in that position. That was the only time of the day they advertised, likely for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s cheap to advertise mid-weekday in a market</li>
  <li>The best suckers are the ones who feel most vulnerable and use Jerry Springer episodes to feel better.
The second reason is likely a stretch and generalization, but there’s also a reason Jerry is only on mid-weekday in most markets.</li>
</ul>

<p>The people protrayed in the ads are those who Corinthian likely hoped would see them: single men and women of all colors who probably had families to feed and insane amounts of debt. They just want to do something good with their life, so why not medial billing or fixing something?</p>

<p>That sounds great, but neither are careers unless you plan on working for a large facility at some point in your life. In order to even be looked at, though, you’ll have to have a full degree from somewhere accredited.</p>

<p>Problems start seeping through the cracks right about now.</p>

<p>Employers cared very little about Corinthian school educations. If two people applied for one job and had all the same qualifications but one got their education at Everest, you know which one the employer will pick.</p>

<p>This became a real problem for a lot of students because the faux job placement assistance ended up being garbage. I’m sure there are a few out there who got jobs, but I doubt they got <em>good</em> jobs. A good comparison is the IT world. There’s a big difference between fixing computers at Best Buy’s Geek Squad for a career, making $12/hour and working on one of Google’s many systems engineering teams, likely making $75/hour.</p>

<p>I do want to say that not all for-profit schools are a waste of time. Quality comes down to what they offer, like I said before. That sounds counter-intuitive, but let me give a great example.</p>

<p>Argosy University. It’s parent company has had their name thrown around before related to other schools in their organization being less than ideal. Argosy University as a school, however, offers actual accredited degrees, however. Some facilities go as high as Ph.D. and Psy.D. level education with industry accrediation. Everest wouldn’t have ever reached that goal with the quality of education they provided.</p>

<p>While I’m sure Argosy’s parent company has had their fair share of exposure for “meh” educational offerings, in post-secondary education, it’s not always appropriate to throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>

<p>Before I wrap up, I want to make it perfectly clear that I used Everest/WyoTech and Argosy as examples because those are examples I am familiar enough with to use as comparisons. I wouldn’t promote or sponsor any of the schools or companies mentioned in this post even if I was paid to, because that’s not right and that’s not what I do on this blog.</p>

<p>I will also make sure to point out that Education Management Corp, the company that owns Argosy University, hasn’t been without its faults, but the level of investigation and potentially shady behavior has been limited to specific schools in specific areas, not the organization as whole.</p>

<p>So with that out of the way, keep an open mind, but don’t be stupid. If it sounds like its too good to be true, it probably is. In the case of Corinthian Colleges, everything they <em>said</em> they did was too good to be true and what they actually provided couldn’t have been farther from what was advertised.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-04-26T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">26 Apr 2015</time>
    <p>A couple days ago I talked about killing in people relations, a.k.a kicking ass at customer service. I suggested a book by Dale Carnegie called How to Win Friends and Influence People. I also said there was a second book I recommend.</p>

<p>That second book is by the CEO of Zappos, the site that sells a ton of shoes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JTHXN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003JTHXN6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=F2YCPEVVP25QDMQI">Delivering Happiness</a> isn’t just about learning how to smooth-talk through the phone or how to close a sale. It’s about making people feel appreciated. The book outlines what Tony Hsieh (pronounced shay) did and still does to make Zappos as awesome as possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pay brand-new employees $2000 to quit.</li>
  <li>Make customer service the responsibility of the entire company-not just a department</li>
  <li>Focus on company culture as the #1 priority</li>
  <li>Apply research from the science of happiness to running a business</li>
  <li>Help employees grow-both personally and professionally.</li>
  <li>Seek to change the world.</li>
  <li>Make money.
I took that list from Amazon’s description. They also feature a Q&amp;A with Hsieh that’s quite enlightening and definitely worth <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JTHXN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003JTHXN6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=F2YCPEVVP25QDMQI">checking out</a>. If you have an Kindle or a tablet, I suggest buying it that way as it’s cheaper than the Hardcover and Paperback, and it takes less space. If you’re like me and feel like taking a nap when you read, get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QADCNS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003QADCNS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=NTRBAV6C7SGGCZEJ">Audible version</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve read it already, let me know what you think.</p>

    <p><a href="//amazon.com">Amazon</a> came out with what equates to a bucket list for books. Their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8192263011">100 Books to Read in a Lifetime</a> features a load of great reads crossing all genres and categories.

    <p>My latest challenge in my career is executing the position of Senior Technical Support Lead for the Americas at <a href="http://getzephyr.com/">Zephyr</a>, the software company that is, I believe, up-ending the software test management space. My primary responsibility is making technical support as awesome as possible for our Americas customers. This got me thinking on what resources I could use to my advantage in bettering the experiences our customers have when they call in or open a case at <a href="http://support.getzephyr.com">support.getzephyr.com</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing is my technical support team needs to be challenged. Not just technically, but challenged within themselves. Each individual needs to be challenged to better themselves including their confidence levels, relationship skills, communication, and being able to think on their feet when the time comes.</p>

<p>That’s a long list of things to work on though and becoming overloaded is the last thing I want to happen which is why I want to use this post to focus on one’s self. There are two really good books that anybody who’s speaking with people on a regular basis should read, one of which I’ll cover today, and the next I’ll cover in my next post.</p>

<p>The first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEAI4E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WEAI4E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlymannet-20&amp;linkId=2EUNCBNEPDTZAPLF">How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie</a>. Yes, Carnegie’s dead. Yes, the book was written in the old days. Yes, it’s still relevant. What he said in 1936 still holds weight today, because at no point in history was it suddenly OK to be happy with mediocrity. No one said that taking a bland lifestyle should be the norm. We used to call the American Dream the American Dream for a reason. If you dream of middle-of-the-road-ness, then go for it.</p>

<p>I’d bet money though, that you don’t.</p>

<p>Here’s what Amazon said in their formal review of the book (emphasis my own):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and <strong>85 percent</strong> to “the ability to <strong>express ideas</strong> , to assume <strong>leadership</strong> , and to <strong>arouse enthusiasm</strong> among people.” He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for <strong>handling people</strong> without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person’s point of view and “arousing in the other person an eager want.”That’s exactly what every individual in a human-facing position should be able to do. There’s a line between being fake and manipulative and being powerful in your position. I don’t think this book covers that and it shouldn’t. Where that line is drawn is wholly up to you, but whoever it is, stand on the good side. As a good friend of mine once told me, “you have to put a leash on it and own it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you only do one thing today make it this: buy this book. Read the hell out of it. Read it again. I want you to consume this knowledge as I will.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page10/" rel="bookmark" title="Norway&#8217;s Radio">Norway&#8217;s Radio</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-04-21T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">21 Apr 2015</time>
    <p>There seems to be a bit of confusion surrounding Norway’s announcement they’ll stop broadcasting FM radio. Someone didn’t do their homework when they started writing titles for the various articles that are covering the matter, so I hope I can spend a few minutes and clarify the topic for you.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the original source. An article by <a href="http://radio.no/2015/04/norway-to-switch-off-fm-in-2017/">Radio.no</a> uses the following title in their article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Norway to Switch Off FM in 2017That sounds pretty ominous like there’s an end to radio broadcasting as we know it, or something. Other news outlets are twisting it into being Norway killing radio altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too bad that’s not the whole story. The article goes on to talk about how “the Ministry of Culture announced a national FM-switch off, to complete the transition to digital radio.” Wait, so we’re not killing off FM radio? They just said FM is going away.</p>

<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>FM as we know it (the analog broadcasting medium that requires a lot of radio bandwidth and provides little result) is going away… eventually. In Norway, it’ll start on January 11th, 2017 and will start with national broadcasters like NRK, P4, and SBS. The end of this transition is slated for December 13th of the same year, almost a full 12 months. So really, analog FM radio is dead in Norway on December 13, 2017, not January 11th.</p>

<p>What won’t cease to exist is radio broadcasting. Norway is dropping analog FM for an open standard called DAB or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting#Single-frequency_networks">Digital Audio Broadcasting</a>. It also goes by the name Eureka-147 in the standards world because it was created as a research project in the late 90s for the European Union by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(organization)">Eureka</a>, a pan-European research and development organization.</p>

<p>Digital Audio Broadcasting is like the United States’ HDRadio, except the US version is proprietary and owned by a corporation (not surprising, really). According to what I’ve read about DAB and the specs therein, it’s essentially over-the-air broadcasting of MP2 or AAC-encoded audio and is broadcasted as a part of a package of streams within a chunk of radio frequency. Each broadcast allows for 1000kbps of bandwidth per “channel” whereas HDRadio only allows 300kbps and is based on a main broadcast with digital simulcasts immediately above and below on the spectrum.</p>

<p>Digital Audio Broadcasting will never likely catch on in America since the Federal Communications Commission chose <a href="http://hdradio.com">HD Radio</a> is the go-to standard nor will analog radio broadcasts ever <a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-02-286A1.pdf">likely be eliminated</a> in the states, which I’m sure broadcasters here both enjoy and hate at the same time.</p>

<p>Analog terrestrial radio takes an immense amount of power to do successfully and the amount of interference from neighboring towers and stations gets higher as you increase said power. Analog radio bleeds a lot into neighboring frequencies unlike digital so the amount of stations possible in the FM band is limited more so in comparison to all digital broadcasts.</p>

<p>Norway has the right idea. Sure they won’t be using the FM frequencies, anymore, but what does that matter? FM is too low to support any meaningful data transfer and the frequency bands for DAB (Band III in particular) are high enough to stay out of the way of FM (should it become a free zone like CB and Wifi) but low enough to avoid other arbitrary bands used for other purposes. In America, though, Band III covers half of the old analog TV spectrum (174-216mhz plus a few mobile and fixed radio uses). Combining that with the FCC going with HD Radio, DAB is dead in the American water.</p>

<p>I don’t forsee anything to worry about. Typically people that freak out about stuff like this don’t really realize they might already be in a digital broadcasting area and just don’t know it. Analog’s death as a broadcasting medium should have happened a decade ago. It’s expensive and power-hungry and offers very little in terms of feature.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page10/" rel="bookmark" title="Ten Days a Californian">Ten Days a Californian</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-04-16T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">16 Apr 2015</time>
    <p>If my calendar is correct, ten days of living in California is today. As someone who’s lived in one state their whole life, nay, one metro area in one state, it’s been a huge change. The world around me is fresh and exciting, but equally craptacular.</p>

<p>The good news is, I’m not leaving. Maybe that’s also the bad news, who knows. We’re here for the long haul and I’ve discussed and mentally prepared for it <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/scared-to-act">quite</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/be-ready">far</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/couch-chapter">in</a> <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/wasted">advance</a>. I even highlighted my trip by day in summary (day <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-1">1</a>, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-2">2</a>, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-3">3</a>, <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/move-day-4">4</a>) and <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/dust-settling">reflected</a> briefly after all the dust settled.</p>

<p>I’ll just come right out and say it: this place is dry. Not dry like “my clothes are dry, this dryer rocks!” More like: “my clothes turn to dust! This dryer rocks!” The humidity was 14% today. That might not seem like much but to compare, think desert. No, not dessert. One “s,” like the sounds snakes make… in the desert.</p>

<p>See exhibit A.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/361745-5.jpeg?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>That about sums it up.</p>

<p>It’s not all bad, though. Moving from a state that gets eight feet of rain a year to a state that gets sloppy seconds from Mother Nature has perks. It’s sunny, a lot! This time of year, we were lucky to see the sun. It rained. Of course now that I’ve moved away, Washington’s getting a sexy session with the sun and there’s a lot of sun to go around.</p>

<p>I’m also tan. It took exactly one day to become tan. Us northern people tan easy. Too bad it doesn’t make traffic any less of a suck-fest and California drivers any more skilled at using their turn signals.</p>

<p>I could rant for a solid hour on California drivers, but I don’t think that’s necessary. This guy has a pretty good summary on video, so consume this 18 minutes of sad-but-true. Half of this I see on a regular basis.</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMR_BVpMvl8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I don’t feel I’ve given California enough credit. The ocean is damn awesome and I love being so close to it. Without traffic, it’s 45 minutes. That’s spectacular. In Washington, it was a four hour romp (each way) that included an hour (each way) and $50 (round trip) on a ferry. Given the scale of the Bay Area, everything’s so close, too. Public transit (train-based) is legit and quick to move around. The bus system blows harder than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina">Katrina</a>, though. Who needs to have a 45 minute layover half-way through a 10 mile journey?</p>

<p>Maybe this guy:</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boring.gif"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/boring.gif?resize=500%2C281" alt="boring" /></a></p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

    <p>This was the day we were all waiting for. The day we drive into town, unload the truck, and start our lives in California. This was also the day I forgot how much I don’t like moving up and down stairs.</p>

<p>When I pulled in, I barely fit. The power steering was whining because I insisted on holding the wheel all the way to the right. The truck fit, and the trailer followed behind, by only by a hair. Mere inches were between my front bumper and the gate edge, and same with my trailer wheels. Someone didn’t think the entrance through enough.</p>

<p>Either way, I found a place to park the truck and get rid of the trailer so we could unload. It was warm, but not super hot… 60-something, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>It only took a few hours to unload the truck when we counted breaks. Having help was nice, especially when it came to conquering the three flights of stairs. Before dinner, we were done and the truck was back where it belonged.</p>

<p>So glad it’s over.</p>

    <p>The Siskiyous mountains are rough for a moving truck. At times we hummed along at 55 to 60 mph and when we hit big climbs, we sputtered at 35 to 40. It’s rough going for a gas-powered truck-trailer. If you’re unfamiliar with what I’m talking about, please let me fill you in.</p>

<p>Gas-powered trucks have zero oomph when pulling a load. None. Their torque is present at a much higher rev range than diesel and unfortunately, those higher revs also sit close to the engine’s limit. I wanted to give the truck 100% throttle to power up the hills, but if I did, I felt it would explode. See, to make our journey up a 7% grade even at 40 mph, the engine needed to run at 4000-4250 RPM. For scale, the gauge stops at 6000 and the truck shifts well before then. I was at my limit.</p>

<p>Even with such slow and gas-guzzling climbs, we managed to stay on target for fuel usage and didn’t lose too much time. The most embarrassing part: loaded semi trucks passing you. Damn you, Budget Truck.</p>

<p>After we got out of the mountains, we made a quick pit stop in Redding, CA to top off and sprinted to Sacramento, where we met friends for our last night on the road.</p>

    <p>Now the real fun begins. There’s nothing more that I’ve wanted from life than to drive a 40’ truck-trailer combination over 900 miles. Today’s journey took us to Medford, OR, where we make our first of two on-the-road stops.</p>

<p>We chose to stay in the Ramada, and it’d been so long since I stayed in a place like that I forgot what it was like. Apparently, they opted to not redecorate since I last stayed in one in the 90s. The hotel was crap. I’m not sure it was worth the $64 a night price tag, but at least the WiFi was good. It was great actually. Probably because nobody was actually staying there besides truckers. The bed was hard and the breakfast was meh, but it did its job as a place to sleep for the night. Medford is a surprisingly beautiful area. The south Oregon mountains are awesome and quite a site to see, compared to the rest of the state.</p>

<p>Not much happened on the journey south. We sat in the truck for nine hours including stops, filled up once with what seemed like an entire tanker of gas, and somehow managed 12mpg, with car trailer. I was quite impressed, but at the same time, not. Budget really needs to stop using gas engines in their tow-capable trucks. We could have skipped a stop if we were rolling in a diesel truck.</p>

<p>I experienced a Popeye’s for the second time in my life. The first time involved me wishing I hadn’t experienced Popeye’s. This time, it was actually decent, but considering this was the fourth or fifth meal involving fast food, I was starting to feel pretty gross.</p>

<p>The bane of my existence has yet to come, however.</p>

    <p>Today’s the day. We packed up all our stuff over the last couple of weeks and picked up our moving truck this morning. We loaded it all in a relatively short amount of time (we do only have an apartment, after all). So far, the trip’s been alright, as we haven’t left town, yet, and won’t until tomorrow morning. Funny story, though…</p>

<p>We were up at 6:30 getting ready to start the long day. I’m dreading the level of effort that’s about to be bestowed upon me by the laws of gravity and physics. By 7:30 we had breakfast. Thanks Jack in the Box!</p>

<p>By 8:00am, we were at the rental truck facility. By virtue of being the lowest price for our one-way trip, we graced Budget Truck with our presence. The place looked kinda sketchy and rightly so: it was nothing more than a double-wide. For a place that also offered rental cars via Avis, it was hard to tell what cars were actually available to rent.</p>

<p>At 8:30 we had the truck back home and ready to accept our crap. Most of our stuff was already boxed up so it came down to making trips two and from the truck with the dolly. This part only took a couple hours. Most of our furniture was boxed up (we ordered some new stuff, because why not!).</p>

<p>Come 10:30 and we’re back at Budget Truck ready for our car trailer. We’re taking a 22-foot truck (16 feet cargo space plus six feet for the chassis, give or take) and adding another 16.5-foot trailer on the back. I love the plan. This $45 trailer will net us $150 in gas savings.</p>

<p>Did I mention we have a cat? No? Well… we have a cat, and this is where it starts getting interesting.</p>

<p>It’s now 12:00 and we’re at our hotel, the Holiday In Express &amp; Suites. I’ve stayed there before and they were pretty nice for a 3-star hotel. I expected more nice-but-not-worthy-of-instagramming experiences. We checked in, and informed them of our cat, because I want to make sure the reservation at a pet-friendly hotel was still legitimate. Turns out it was, they are pet friendly. As it also turns out, they charge $50 per three nights as an added fee, like paying for a room for your pet. Oh… but according to Hanna, the wonderfully nice woman at the reception desk explained the moment she, herself discovered for the first time it seemed, they don’t take cats.</p>

<p>So there’s that.</p>

<p>I’m in a bit of a subdued panic because our whole schedule is pretty well locked down. We already turned in our apartment keys and for all intents and purposes, we’re transients. I’ll be honest, I paid $90 for my room through Hotwire. I thought it was a good deal. That’s about the price I paid the last time I stayed at HIES via Hotwire, roughly two to three years ago.</p>

<p>I give Hotwire a call, crossing my fingers they’ll refund my non-refundable purchase. Turns out they will, only if the room and or reservation isn’t as advertised. I had the right in two areas: 1) they were only <em>partially</em> pet friendly, something Hotwire didn’t advertise properly, and 2) the rate on Hotwire’s site should have been the only amount I had to pay, which it wasn’t. After roughly five minutes, it was all squared away and I had my money back.</p>

<p>But now what? I’m without a hotel room. In comes my trusty hotel sidekick to the rescue.</p>

<p>There’s a single hotel chain that’s always come through for my family and my wife’s family alike, the La Quinta. It’s roughly on the same level as HIES, and about the same price. I gave them a rang because I know their properties and know what kind of rooms they offer up. An ever so friendly gentleman named Kurtis (I checked, he spells it that way) helped us out. They had a room open tonight and they were pet friendly. They also don’t charge a fee, because that’s weird.</p>

<p>Since I’m a AAA member, they took 10% off and we were in business for $100. Sure it was $10 more, but I’d rather pay that difference than $50. It was within reason. Within 20 minutes we had our room and were moving in for the night.</p>

<p>It’s 1:00pm and nap time.</p>

<p>At around 3:30, my wife found it prudent to give our other hotel reservations a call and find out if they charge a separate pet fee. Turns out they both did. The Ramada in Medford, OR charges $20, and the Double Tree in Newark, CA charges $50. The $20 is okay, the $50 is not. I called Hotwire again, and complained once more. I fed them a story about false advertising and whatnot, and within a few minutes I had my money back, again. It would be great if Hotwire advertised extra fees like this before you buy your supposedly non-refundable stay.</p>

<p>I enjoyed our stay at the La Quinta. While it’s nothing special to look at they’re good at making breakfast and having comfy beds. They could step up their WiFi game a bit. The particular hotel I stayed at had misconfigured WiFi. All of their hotspots were on the same channel. If you’re not technically inclined enough to know what that means, let me use this analogy: imagine six people talking to you at the same time, at the same volume, saying the same thing. Which one are you going to pay attention to? With all of the hotel’s hotspots on the same frequency, doing the same thing, the airwaves become a garbled mess, and my laptop had a hard time staying connected. Noob move.</p>

<p>Overall, our first day was uneventful. We packed up and rested. The real fun begins on day two.</p>

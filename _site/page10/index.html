    <p>This weekend, while my wife is out of town, I’m spending time reflecting on my routine to determine what I can do to make the most of my abilities.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of routines, in general, so I know that by establishing one that coincides with a planned week, will help, a lot.</p>

    <p>Ever since I discovered Docker, I’ve been a fan. Trying to explain Docker to the un-initiated is also fun. I describe it like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Docker is like a Lunchable (or bento box). The container of said Lunchable is Docker and the VM it controls. Every section inside the container is each of the apps it runs.I try to tell folks that you use a Virtual Machine if you need to control an entirely specific environment. You use Docker if your interest is just with apps. In this day and age, trying to maintain a fleet of systems or virtual machines can be daunting.</p>

    <p>Ever heard the saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m turning over a new leaf?I’d say that, but in this case, the leaf is the same one. This morning I took the time to get back into a morning routine that makes me feel the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m also working on better planning of my week, as per this video:</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="882" height="527" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNxLNY6yxRI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>If you’re not doing this, do it with me. I’d love to hear how it goes.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-07-21T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">21 Jul 2015</time>

    <p>I’ve been internally reflecting on the future of my career quite a bit over the last month or so. One thing I know for sure is where I want my career to head, but what I’m not 100% sure about is how to get there.</p>

<p>My overall plan is to pivot into software development. I enjoy solving technical puzzles, fixing things, and making things, all of which can be accomplished with great detail and satisfaction in software development. At this time I haven’t picked a single language or group of languages to stick to and become an expert in. I feel that’ll come within the next few months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have to figure out how to best build up these new skills I require while still maintaining my current day job, which I don’t dislike.</p>

        10 Web-based CSS Tools

    <p>It’s pretty much impossible to design a site without CSS these days. It controls everything. CSS has a hand in so many visual aspects of a site that it can get daunting to keep track of it all or figure out how to tweak it just a certain way. I came up with a list of various web-based CSS tools that can assist any designer in their front-end development quest. If there’s something I missed, please add it to the comments!</p>

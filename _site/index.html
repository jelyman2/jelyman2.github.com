    <p>Is it too late to add something to my Christmas list?</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/11/9891696/tesla-leather-iphone-case-6-plus">The Verge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, for $45, Tesla will let you wrap your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus with leather that was originally supposed to pad your bottom. (Or your back, I guess.) That’s actually not a bad deal! Leather cases typically run close to the $50 mark as it is. Toss in another $5, and Tesla will add some credit card slots to the case, too. (The company claims that this version is capable of protecting against RFID readers as well.)</p>

    <p><em>And the server belongs to me</em></p>

<p>So as you probably know by now, I converted my blog to <a href="http://jekyllrb.org">Jekyll</a>, yesterday, and it’s been a huge success, in my opinion. I’m motivated more than ever to start blogging more because I have the added tinker factor and using Git and GitHub to keep everything organized rocks.</p>

<p>But that isn’t what this story is about. Tonight’s story is about a server. A lowly VPS floating somewhere in the SFO <a href="http://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>…. ocean. I’ve had this server running for many months–probably over a year now and I just don’t know it–and it’s hosted just about anything and everything I’ve tinkered with including many a failed idea.</p>

<p>I use this server a lot and for the most part it always responds well and isn’t sluggish. It’s hosted my former <a href="http://old.johnathanlyman.com">WordPress blog</a> since January and hasn’t made but a peep about it so I’ve spent quite a bit of time thinking nothing’s amiss. I felt, though, that Jekyll shouldn’t be taking as long as it was to build my site but I couldn’t convince myself the server was overloaded.</p>

<p>As it Turns Out<sup>TM</sup>, I was wrong.</p>

<p>My baby of a server has, for the last five or so months, been filling <a href="http://newrelic.com">Newrelic</a> graphs with stuff like this:</p>

<p><strong>CPU</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_before_cpu.png" alt="CPU" /></p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_before_mem.png" alt="Memory" /></p>

<p><strong>Disk</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_before_disk.png" alt="Disk" /></p>

<p><strong>Load</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_before_load.png" alt="Load Rating" /></p>

<p>So I’m just going to go ahead and say that’s not good. The only graph above that’s even remote decent is the Disk graph, but it’s washed over by the CPU &gt; 80% indication so it’s also pretty much hosed.</p>

<p>At this point I’m honestly surprised. I’m a terrible pseudo-sysadmin and I should be fired but there’s no one to fire me and I’m the boss so whatever. If I can fix all this, I’m giving myself a raise.</p>

<p>I started digging. I wanted to see what’s running and who’s sucking up all the juices. I fired up <code class="highlighter-rouge">top</code> and waited a few seconds. A few things popped up: a couple instances of <code class="highlighter-rouge">node</code> and an instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby</code>.</p>

<p>Hmm. That doesn’t make any sense… I’m not running any node apps and jekyll is the only ruby thing I use right now… oh wait.</p>

<p>See, I tinkered with NodeJS apps late last spring. <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> was a blogging tool I was considering for a while. I also tinkered with <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse</a> to see what it was all about. Turns Out<sup>TM</sup>, neither are suited for my needs.</p>

<p>I don’t really know what happened but I can only assume I forgot about them and they’ve been running all this time. I had a total of five Node instances running and Docker was running Discourse so between the two of them, I was on <code class="highlighter-rouge">swap</code> 24/7. So dirty.</p>

<p>This story isn’t super climactic in any way and the fix was easy: kill all the things. I also found this to be a good time to remove Node and Docker since I need neither.</p>

<p>I still couldn’t figure out why my disk usage was so high, though. Leave it to me to forget about a 4GB <code class="highlighter-rouge">.iso</code> I left in a folder and leave it to Discourse to fail at sending 5GB of emails through postfix over the last five months and clog up my <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/mail</code> folder.
Needless to say, after the almost-winter cleaning, I gained quite a bit of ground:</p>

<p><strong>CPU</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_after_cpu.png" alt="CPU" /></p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_after_mem.png" alt="Memory" /></p>

<p><strong>Disk</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_after_disk.png" alt="Disk" /></p>

<p><strong>Load</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/post_images/loaded_server/loaded_server_after_load.png" alt="Load Rating" /></p>

<p>Sorry this story wasn’t more interesting. If you’re curious, my Jekyll build time was cut in half.</p>

<p>That’s about it. Orphaned tools and processes makes my server a dull VPS.</p>

  <p>When the Mailbox team joined Dropbox in 2013, we shared a passion for simplifying the way people work together. And solving the email problem seemed like a strong complement to the challenges Dropbox was already tackling.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But as we deepened our focus on collaboration, we realized there’s only so much an email app can do to fundamentally fix email. We’ve come to believe that the best way for us to improve people’s productivity going forward is to streamline the workflows that generate so much email in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, it was only a matter of time. I enjoyed Mailbox. When I first discovered it and received my beta invite way back when, I was instantly hooked. The concept of being able to swipe emails around and either put them off until later or never have to deal with them at all was amazing. In my opinion, the best feature about the app was probably the reminder/scheduling swipe.</p>

<p>Deferring an email until “the evening” or at some point in the future when I could pay more attention to it rocked. I would use this almost on a daily basis with my personal emails.</p>

<p>Now, I guess I’m going back to the native Mail app, an app I never left on the Mac<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I could use something like Spark<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> or Inbox. I’m not <em>that</em> resistant to change.</p>

<p>There’s one thing that sets this event up for another one of those things that can be classified by the phrase <em>historically speaking</em>, and Brent Simmons puts it quite succinctly:</p>

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Again… it was only a matter of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2015/12/07/on_apps_that_get_acquired">Brent</a> goes on to <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/12/07/on_apps_that_get_acquired">say</a> a few pretty key things:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When deciding whether or not you can trust an app to stick around, you can’t go by whether or not it was acquired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so true. I like to use <a href="http://niksoftware.com">Nik</a> as an example. A software company that developed photography editing tools, it was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/google-acquires-nik-software-the-company-behind-the-popular-snapseed-photo-editing-app-for-ios/">acquired</a> by Google in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/google-acquires-nik-software-the-company-behind-the-popular-snapseed-photo-editing-app-for-ios/">September 2012</a> but is still going strong as a part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/nikcollection/">Google Nik Collection</a>. If you’re still not sure who Nik are, have you heard of Snapseed?</p>

<p>I’ll pour one out for Mailbox because I have some crappy beer in the fridge, but in a week, I’ll have already moved on.</p>

    <p>Now that I’m running my blog using Jekyll, one thing I’ve already found to be rather frustrating is the post generation process. I have a blank <code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> template I open, save in a new location, then edit, but that seems cumbersome, to me. What I decided to do instead is write a quick Ruby script that generated a post <code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> file for me based on the information I provide.</p>

<h2 id="thought-process">Thought Process</h2>

<p>I wanted to keep it simple, and just do only what I really needed. I don’t need any fancy logic or checking. I know <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> will be there because I put <code class="highlighter-rouge">post_generator.rb</code> inside my Jekyll directory.</p>

<h2 id="working-example">Working Example</h2>

<p>Here’s my code as it stands inside right now:</p>

<noscript><pre># Generate a new jekyll blog post using prompts then place it in the _posts folder.

puts &#39;Enter the post title:&#39;
title = gets.chomp

puts &#39;Enter the date (YYYY-MM-DD):&#39;
date = gets.chomp

# TODO: Leave date blank to use system date.

puts &#39;Enter the category:&#39;
category = gets.chomp

dirty_slug = title.split(&#39; &#39;)
clean_slug = []
dirty_slug.each do |s|
  clean_slug &lt;&lt; s.downcase
  clean_slug &lt;&lt; &#39;-&#39;
end

clean_slug.pop
final_slug = clean_slug.join(&#39;&#39;)

the_post_permalink = &quot;/#{date}/#{final_slug}/&quot;

the_post_file_name = date.to_s + &#39;-&#39; + final_slug.to_s + &#39;.md&#39;
the_post_file = File.new(&quot;_posts/#{the_post_file_name}&quot;, &#39;w&#39;)
the_post_file.puts(&#39;---&#39;)
the_post_file.puts(&quot;title: \&quot;#{title}\&quot;&quot;)
the_post_file.puts(&#39;author: Johnathan Lyman&#39;)
the_post_file.puts(&#39;layout: post&#39;)
the_post_file.puts(&quot;permalink: #{the_post_permalink}&quot;)
the_post_file.puts(&#39;categories:&#39;)
the_post_file.puts(&quot;    - #{category}&quot;)
the_post_file.puts(&#39;---&#39;)
the_post_file.puts(&#39;&#39;)
the_post_file.close

system(&#39;atom&#39;, &quot;_posts/#{the_post_file_name}&quot;)</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/0043d1411df30d05c71b.js"> </script>

<p>It’s functional. It’s not clean and could be refactored a but, but it works.</p>

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<p>A few things that came to mind after I finished:
- Use the system date if none is provided
- Re-format the title with title-casing. Without <code class="highlighter-rouge">ActiveSupport</code> in Rails, I’ll have to either require it as a gem or write something by hand. I’m thinking the former.
- Allow the user to write the post right there in the command line and not have to open a text editor.
- Allow the user to choose which text editor to use at the prompt (perhaps with detection?)</p>

<p>It’s a good first draft and it serves the purpose I had in mind. Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/jelyman2/jekyll-post-generator">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

    <p>It’s taken a while for me to mentally get to this point but today I finally crossed the threshold and converted my blog into one generated by Jekyll. Essentially, every time I post or make a change, the blog is rebuilt into static files making the load on my server super light as well as saving disk space. On top of it all, I really wanted to tinker with the idea.</p>

<p>There were a few reasons why I finally bit the bullet and I wanted to share them in hopes that one day someone will stumble across this post and finally take the plunge like I did.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>WordPress is getting kinda fat</strong>. I’ve seen fatter CMSes (anyone remember PostNuke– the year 2002 was fun.) As someone who’s getting more and more into software development and tinkering with code in general, WordPress is a beast I don’t want to tackle, to be honest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I really only need a couple features</strong>. And one of those is a blog. It’s pretty easy to do that with just about anything and with the level of potential complexity<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> that WordPress can introduce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Comments, psh.</strong>. I can’t think of a time when I <em>really</em> wanted to have comments on blog posts. I only did it on WordPress because I honestly felt like I should. Now that I’m in complete control and this blog serves more of a purpose of me saying things and people consuming that information, comments sections aren’t really necessary. If you want to comment on something, send me an <a href="/contact">email</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I feel more developer-y</strong>. I don’t know if <em>not</em> using WordPress is a requirement for this one but it just feels right. I really enjoyed the setup process and learned a lot about the whole thing. Granted I have a bit of experience with <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Ruby&amp;q=user%3Ajelyman2&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=✓">Ruby</a>, already, which really helped in troubleshooting.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So with all that being said, here it is. Every time I update, I push the new files to both a <a href="http://jelyman2.github.io">GitHub repo</a> and my server at the same time<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> so I have redundancy and it’s an easy way to show off what i’m doing to make this site interesting using a popular static site generator.</p>

<p>Over the next couple weeks, I’ll be sure to share any unique experiences I had and what I learned from them so stay tuned!</p>

    <p>I started the Bloc Rails Web Development bootcamp three weeks ago and I’d like to go over my experiences so far.</p>

<p>The last few weeks have been pretty great, actually. There’s a lot of material to cover but it’s done in such a way that it’s broken down into small chunks. Assignments extend on the material being taught and incorporate material learned prior. Each assignment builds on the one before it and the beginning project walks you through the entire process.</p>

<p>Future projects are more open-ended and require the student to call upon what was learned in order to succeed. I am only a few weeks in after all so I haven’t been able to relfect upon the open-ended projects. However taking a cursory glance at them tells me they’re not overly challenging but they do require dedication and that you paid attention to the introductory courses.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next three weeks. With Christmas approaching, I don’t suspect I’ll be as active in the program (I’ve progressed much farther than the minimum states). After the first of the year, I predict I’ll be into one of the open projects and what I’ve learned will be tested. A challenge never hurts.</p>

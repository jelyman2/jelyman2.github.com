        After Three Weeks

    <p>I started the Bloc Rails Web Development bootcamp three weeks ago and I’d like to go over my experiences so far.</p>

<p>The last few weeks have been pretty great, actually. There’s a lot of material to cover but it’s done in such a way that it’s broken down into small chunks. Assignments extend on the material being taught and incorporate material learned prior. Each assignment builds on the one before it and the beginning project walks you through the entire process.</p>

<p>Future projects are more open-ended and require the student to call upon what was learned in order to succeed. I am only a few weeks in after all so I haven’t been able to relfect upon the open-ended projects. However taking a cursory glance at them tells me they’re not overly challenging but they do require dedication and that you paid attention to the introductory courses.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next three weeks. With Christmas approaching, I don’t suspect I’ll be as active in the program (I’ve progressed much farther than the minimum states). After the first of the year, I predict I’ll be into one of the open projects and what I’ve learned will be tested. A challenge never hurts.</p>

    <p>It’s easy to miss the small picture when looking at the big picture. Thinking about what I have ahead of me in terms of the next year at Bloc gives me two thoughts: it’s going to take a long time and it’s easy to not see the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>Bloc is a long program. It covers a lot of material in great detail. For the un-initiated, it can take quite some time. I’m told that based on my 72-week track, I should be doing five “checkpoints” per week. It’s Tuesday and I’ve killed seven. I know it might not always be like this and the first weeks are always the “yeah let’s do this!” weeks. As time goes on, the sheer size of the program will really start to show itself but the one thing I’ll need to keep in mind is that no matter how many different <em>things</em> I still have to do, I need to just focus on one at a time.</p>

<p>Before I know it, I’ll be done.</p>

        Starting Soon: Bloc.io

    <time datetime="2015-10-31T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>I officially signed up last week for Bloc.io’s Full-stack developer bootcamp becuase I feel while I can learn a good deal of stuff on my own, I’m not going to make on my own to the level I need to be in order to make a fundamental career shift to software development that will actually still support my family.</p>

<p>The program doesn’t officially start until the 9th of November so I have a little over a week to go. It’ll be a long year and change and a lot of new stuff will come my way. I’ve only scratched the surface of what Ruby and Rails can do. I started a simple Rails app a couple days ago that could one day turn into the platform for any and all of my sites, if I stick to it, enough. Right now, I don’t know enough on how to make it great.</p>

<p>With time, I will, and as I progress the app will improve. My goal is to one day have it replace WordPress as my blog, portfolio of work, and anything else about me I feature online. I may even adapt it to restart my photography portfolio.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to what I’ll be learning in the coming months and I’ll be sure to share all of it with you.</p>

        How to Fix Misspelled Column Names in a Ruby on Rails Database
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-10-25T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">25 Oct 2015</time>

    <p>I came across a small issue this afternoon while building out one of my first Ruby on Rails apps. When I generated the database table, I misspelled a column name. Luckily for me, it’s easy enough to fix and this is how I did it.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-new-migration">1. Create a New Migration</h3>
<p>At the command line from within your Rails application folder, run this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/d6017c61588d2bfbe2fa.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/d6017c61588d2bfbe2fa">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p>You’ll be generating a new database migration with the name FixColumnName (which interprets to <code class="highlighter-rouge">[timestamp]_fix_column_name.rb</code>) inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db/migrate</code> folder inside your rails application. Open that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.rb</code> file and update it so it looks something like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/2e29faf460cff05f803b.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/2e29faf460cff05f803b">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">:table_name</code> – the name of the table in question</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">:old_column</code> – the misspelled column name<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">:new_column</code> – the correct column nameIf you have multiple columns you need to change, introduce additional <code class="highlighter-rouge">rename_column</code> functions:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/9ea9fba6529008ed08dc.js"></script>
<noscript>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/jelyman2/9ea9fba6529008ed08dc">Gist</a>.</noscript>
<p>Keep in mind that after this migration, you’ll need to update your references to the column everywhere within your app.</p>

<p>Seems like a simple fix but as someone who’s relatively new to Ruby on Rails, this saved me a load of time figuring out what to do and preventing me from starting over.</p>

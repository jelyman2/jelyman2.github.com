        The Cold Brew Coffee Adventure
      </a>

    <p>So I’ve been experimenting with brewing my own coffee like the ways of the eskimos: cold.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe they brewed their coffee hot. I’m just guessing.</p>

<p>I know this whole ‘small-batch’ trend is quite invariably hipster and I’m certainly one of the last people to jump on that bandwagon, but sometimes one just has to concede when another makes superior coffee.</p>

<p>Plus I knew it went mainstream when Starbucks started offering it.</p>

<p>So what is this cold-brew coffee I speak of and why is it so much better?Let me keep it simple, since I don’t want to bore you with all the sicence-y stuff.</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup.jpg"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup-1024x683.jpg" alt="boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-beans-coffee-closeup" /></a></p>

<p>Instead of running hot water through ground coffee, you let ground coffee “seep” in a bucket/pitcher/container of cool water for 12-24 hours. Once it’s sat and stewed in its own substance, filter out the grounds. I use a large mixing bowl as the catch device. Cheesecloth works well for filtering so long as you kept your grounds coarse. If it’s fine powder, you might be better off with a coffee filter (although the filtering process will take much longer).</p>

<p>My mixture is roughly 3.5 to 4 cups of grounds per one gallon of cold tap water. I don’t pack the grounds into the measuring cup. You’ll need about 1/3 to 1/2 lb of ground coffee beans to make this happen. In my home, one gallon of the liquid energy lasts through about six 20-oz cups with ice filled about half way. For my wife and I, that’s three days. We add a splash of sweet-cream creamer (two splashes for me, I like it sweet and ass kicking at the same time) and it’s done. We used to use simple syrup like the coffee shops but at $5 per 12oz bottle, I was using 1/3 the bottle per one gallon of coffee.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how the coffee chains make it but this is my process.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice about the flavor is it’s a lot richer, but not as bitter. When we used to brew hot coffee, we’d get light roast beans for the least bitterness possible. Now, we use whatever because the flavor profile seems to be more consistent and the level of bitterness just isn’t there in the cold coffee.</p>

<p>It’s also a lot stronger. That hot liquid in your coffee maker has seconds with the grounds. We’re giving the liquid hours to really make something special out of their time together. If I skip breakfast, I’m taking it to 11 within an hour or two.</p>

<p>When it comes to price, there’s no question on how much cheaper this process is.</p>

<p>At Starbucks, it’s $3.55 plus tax for a 20-oz cold-brew iced coffee.</p>

<p><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup.jpg"><img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup-1024x508.jpg" alt="boss-fight-free-high-quality-stock-images-photos-photography-coffee-beans-closeup" /></a></p>

<p>By my math and based on my costs, it’s running us $2.75 to $3.00 for one gallon of cold-brew iced coffee, or $0.42 to $0.47 per 20-oz cup.</p>

<p>Obviously ice plays a factor in all this and the cost varies but there’s no doubting that we’re saving quite a bit of money in exchange for roughly 20 minutes of my day (10 in the beginning to grind and 10 to filter at the end).</p>

<p>Is it worth it? Totally. One thing I’d do differently, though is get some sort of pitcher that has a core to keep the grounds in that can be pulled out and emptied. I’m facing cheesecloth damage and stray grounds-in-my-brew issues. Pitchers like this sell for $20 on Amazon. Also worth the purchase, in my opinion.</p>

    <p>David Smith (also known as “Underscore David Smith”) dropped Sleep++, an Apple Watch app that allows you to track your sleep a la Fitbit and others. The key here is needing to keep your watch on all the time. So how do you do it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>TL/DR</em> is to charge your Apple Watch in the morning while you get ready for your day (take a shower, get dressed, etc) and then again in the evening while you get ready for bed (brush teeth, put on pajamas, etc). Then put your Apple Watch in Airplane Mode while you sleep.Read more about this process <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/21/how-to-wear-your-apple-watch-24-slash-7/">over on his blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems like the company is starting to shift its focus, if only a little bit. Instead of forming links people can use to reach new heights in their careers, LinkedIn is encouraging people to actually — get this — talk to the people in their circles.While these companies may be putting Slack “in their crosshairs” doesn’t mean they’re a good shot.</p>

    <p>I received an email just a bit ago of the political donation variety. It’s worth mentioning that a few years ago I guess I ended up on a Scott Walker mailing list. I’m not entirely sure how that happened, but it did.</p>

<p>Before I unsubscribed this morning, I actually read the email and there were two things that stood out to me. First, this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The governor emailed me early this morning specifically asking for your help before the end of the month.Did he, now? Does he even know who I am? Given I haven’t given him a dollar in the history of ever, I wonder why he was so interested in me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mass email was a “forward” of the “email” that Scott Walker “sent” via his “iPhone.” I put all those words in quotes because I don’t think it actually happened.</p>

<p>The second line was amusing, too, and made me chuckle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colleen, I’ve been reviewing grassroots leaders in the 98036 zip code and I don’t have Johnathan’s contact info. Will you please send them a message asking for an urgent contribution before the end of the month? We really need them on our team.Let me know as soon as you hear from Johnathan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>So you’re trying to get money from me by making me believe that Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin actually emailed you, citing me, and a zip code I don’t live in, on purpose? Because I’ve given zero dollars, I’m somehow probably good for donating a bunch of cash on short notice?</p>

<p>Pretty weak, but then again, this is American PoliticsTM for you.</p>

    <p>If you asked me how I felt about this topic a few years ago, I would have told you it’s dumb. If you asked me how I felt about becoming a software developer, I would have told you I’d never do it, it’s not something I find interesting. If you told me that we could fast forward three years and my tone would be different, I would have laughed in your face.</p>

<p>Well, here we are, three years later. I’m slowly starting to entertain development-related career paths. It’s an uphill battle, for sure, and it’ll take quite a bit of time to work out, but I see a future ahead of me that I didn’t see before. One thing that’s different about now is where I live. Here in Silicon Valley, software is everything. No one gives two shits about hardware because it’s become so heavily commoditized. The homeless guy pushing his shopping cart down the street right now probably has a DigitalOcean account and is stealthily building his startup.</p>

<p>At no point am I saying “me too” when it comes to making an app or building a thing. I do, however, like building things, and software helps me do that. I can still draw upon my roots in this new space but it’s important for me to be open and ready to experience.</p>

<p>The next year is going to be interesting.</p>

    <p>One thing I never did when I moved my blog to johnathanlyman.com and away from jlyman.net was to add SSL. I had SSL set up and running on jlyman.net purely because of the low cost of entry. At $10/year, basic SSL gives great HTTPS encryption. Privacy is important, and while I don’t take or give sensetive personal information, it’s still a nice thing to have.</p>

<p>I added SSL to this domain last week and am thinking I made a great choice. Every site I fire up from now on will have it. It’s hard to say no at $10 a year… I think I waste more than that on crap I end up throwing away.</p>

    <p>I was thinking about things that entertain me, this morning, and one thing that came to mind was how long I’ve followed the less-than-family-friendly <a href="http://explosm.net">Explosm</a> comic series. In today’s world, we take things quite seriously sometimes, almost too much. It’s good to take a breather once in a while.</p>

    <p>Comcast, I hope you’re reading this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SageTV founder (and current Google employee) Jeffrey Kardatzke says that Google “has agreed to open-source the SageTV platform.”[<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/16/google-open-sourcing-sage-tv/?ncid=rss_truncated">s</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar, SageTV has been off the market for a few years now after being one of the first to release a DVR box and home theater PC software title. Google bought it up and pulled it away, only to end up using it in their Google Fiber TV box.</p>

<p>It’s great to see this kind of move. There’s a lot of capability in set top boxes that go untouched. I can speak from experience with my X1 box from Comcast. I have HDMI in and out, of which I can only use the OUT. I also have USB and Ethernet, both of which do nothing. I would love to be able to use the ethernet jack instead. It would behoove Comcast to switch to an IPTV-type setup, instead. The bandwidth of traditional cable (QAM256) is limited to something like 39mbps per channel, and each channel is typically split in half (since there aren’t enough channels in the spectrum for 1:1 usage). That brings us down to 19.8mbps per channel, at max. That’s not bad, but it could be better. Blu-Ray discs are usually 25-35mbps for video and roughly 5-8mbps for audio. Compressed 5.1 is roughly 1.5mbps so taking that out of our 19.8mbps stream leaves us with 18.3mbps.</p>

<p>But enough about that. I can ramble about the quality of a TV signal all day. The point is that each stream could be any number of bits in size, not just a technological maximum of 19.8mbps. The trick would be switching streams in a timely manner and implementing some pretty hardcore QoS all along the pipe to ensure the TV signal doesn’t become degraded because your kids are having a LAN party in their room and sucking up all the Internets.</p>

<p>Even without a move to IPTV, opening up a box to other apps and developers would make for a much more desirable platform, regardless of the vendor. One thing I’ve always wanted on my X1 was a Netflix app. Will that happen? Probably not, so long as Comcast has a beef with Netflix.</p>

<p>The trick will be to not let too many crazy things through the flood gates. If app developers start making shoddy apps, the quality of service for the entire system becomes compromised, and we know how Google loves to keep Android and open platform and what that ultimately does for the quality of apps.</p>

  <p>You can’t think yourself out of a writing block; you have to write yourself out of a thinking block.  — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)" title="John Rogers">John Rogers</a>These words are very true, and I have the experience to back them up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last week, I spent 30 minutes <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half-hour" title="Half Hour of Random">writing non-stop</a>. I didn’t think about what I was writing, nor did I stop to even see if what I wrote flowed. At the end, I just published it. The premise behind that exercise was to not just pad my monthly word count, but to simply see what ideas come to mind as I write.</p>

<p>The result was quite interesting. There were clear transitions between topics, but each of those topics was a morph from the one previous. It’s as though when I was discussing one thing, another idea started forming in my mind.</p>

<p>Another prime example is just today when I was discussing <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/sage" title="Open-Source SageTV">SageTV</a>. I started going on about QAM 256 and channel bandwidth and other non-related stuff all to come back to the point of there being better ways to go about executing a set top box in 2015 like what Google’s doing.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)" title="John Rogers">Rogers</a> is talking about. I could easily have another couple posts right there about things I have at least some knowledge of. I could explain the intricacies of QAM and bore the hell out of you. I could also explain why open-sourcing a set-top box is both a great and a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Perhaps I will. Who knows. The point is that I wouldn’t have even thought of those topics to talk about had I not written about them.</p>

<p>This is one of the many reasons why I like writing on a regular basis. There isn’t some massive end-goal in mind. I’m not trying to build a mega-blog full of money-making ideas that I can litter with ads and end up in a penthouse. Not even close. I write because it stimulates my mind and gives me new things to talk about and new ideas to ponder. There isn’t another medium of creativity where I’ve been able to work out how to write at a pace of almost 3500 words an hour.</p>

<p>Some say I should really write a book.</p>

    <p>Voyager 1 and 2. Covering a million miles a day, these two crafts are still humming along. After 40 years of travel, they still gather data, and some of the original crew still watch over them… even if they do so from a simple office park in Pasadena.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/15/voyager-1-and-2-space-journey-nasa">Reading about Steve Howard</a>, 65, the man who’s in a group of people controlling the space crafts from 16 light hours away, is quite humbling. Voyager 1 took a “family photo” of the solar system 25 years ago and in 2036, will shut down. Most sensors will do so long before the nine 2025 as its Plutonium-238 reactor dwindles into nothingness, but an eleven more years is still an impressive feat. </p>

<p>Howard will be 90 by then. There isn’t much of a change either Voyager will find anything super interesting until 40,000 years from now, when they’ll be dead metal and nothing more.</p>

<p>The next time you complain your internet is slow, think about Steve and his 17 34 hour round-trip transmission time from his computer, through the Deep Space Network, to Voyager 1. </p>

    <p>I’ve been mulling this idea over in my head for a few weeks, now and now I think it’s time to start it. I’m starting a series of posts on various managed WordPress offerings and my impressions of them. Since I run a WordPress site by hand, I believe it’ll allow me to have a fair point of view when it comes to transitioning to a managed service.</p>

<p>What I’ll be looking for is a roughly the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signup Process. How easy was it to sign up for the service?</li>
  <li>Migration. How much time would it take to migrate a site and if it costs more, how much extra?</li>
  <li>Launching. How easy it is to go live from the time the account becomes active?</li>
  <li>Extra Features. Are things like SSL and CDNs included? Are they limited to certain plans? </li>
  <li>Price Point. How much would it cost to get into the service?</li>
  <li>Free Trials. This is a big one for a lot of people. Does the service have a free trial that can be exercised? 
Here’s a list of the services I plan on going over in the next month or so:</li>
</ul>

<p>Flywheel<br />
Kinsta<br />
Pagely<br />
MediaTemple<br />
DreamHost<br />
Pantheon<br />
WPEngine<br />
WordPress.com<br />
Synthesis<br />
Pressable</p>

<p>If you have any other services you’d like to see covered, please let me know in the comments below.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

    <p>I’m a fan of getting as much as you can for free without breaking the rules.</p>

    <p>I love logs. I love massive amounts of data. I have this thing where if I feel I can consume and process tons of data by doing something menial and useless, I’ll do it. </p>

<p>One thing I don’t really do though is keep tabs on the logs for my site and its services. This is where <a href="http://loggly.com">Loggly</a> comes in, and this is my experience getting it set up.</p>

<p>Signing up was pretty easy. I just went to <a href="http://loggly.com">loggly.com,</a> clicked Sign Up in the top right corner, filled out a few things, and waited patiently while their systems used magic fairy dust and unicorn blood to construct my logging instance. They provide a full 30-day trial that gives a user full access to all features to determine if it’s really right for them. After 30 days, it drops down to their limited free tier, which is still good for small people like me.</p>

<p>I’m writing this as I go through their service, so let’s take a moment to talk about what Loggly actually does.</p>

<p>The whole goal of Loggly is to provide centralized log management without the need for agents. This allows sysadmins or anybody who cares to view and track log data in real time. You can search through logs as they come in and graph out instances of particular events to track down issues as they’re happening.</p>

<p>Logy allows you to track logs from almost any source. Their list is pretty exhaustive if you ask me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows</li>
  <li>Linux</li>
  <li>Apache</li>
  <li>Nginx</li>
  <li>IIS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Tomcat</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
  <li>Rails</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Django</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Node.JS</li>
  <li>.NET</li>
  <li>Docket</li>
  <li>Puppet</li>
  <li>Chef</li>
  <li>FluentD</li>
  <li>AWS Cloudtrail</li>
  <li>AWS S3</li>
  <li>and Heroku
That really is a pretty big list.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mentioned that you can get started for free than that there’s a free tier, but let’s talk about what that actually means and the other options that are available.</p>

<p>The free tier gives you the basics including searching and filters, persistent workspaces, and built-in alerting. The standard tier ($49/month) gives you 1GB/day of log storage and 7-day retention, unlimited users, built-in alerting, customized dashboards, and more.</p>

<p>Moving to the Pro tier is where you start getting some of the more tasty features.  You get peak overage protection, AWS S3 archiving, telephone support, and more. The default plan grants 15 days of retention at $109/month, but if you need more than that, you’re more than welcome to it: 10GB/day for $499, 50GB/day for $2500 and more. If 50GB/day and $2500 sounds like a lot, don’t worry, it is. 50GB of log files in a day though is a lot and if you need that kind of support, you’re not too worried about the price. </p>

<p>The second half of this post is to follow after my account is set up… see you soon!</p>

    <p>This is a continuation of part 1: <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/loggly-start">Getting Started with Loggly</a>.</p>

<p>Note: Apparently waiting hours for account generation isn’t a thing according to the fine folks on twitter @loggly.</p>

<p>Now that we’re signed up, let’s get down to the good stuff!</p>

<p>The first thing I want to do is start tracking Linux. The <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/stack">core of my site</a> is Ubuntu (among other things). Loggly makes this easy. All I need to do is click the Linux icon on my account’s main page.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1419.52.30.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>It really is as simple as copying the two lines of code and running them with superuser access. Within a few seconds, Loggly grabbed a hold and started showing me cool stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.05.00.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s pretty empty now, because I literally just started tracking and I’m only tracking Linux. With time this will become more populated and more interesting to parse through.</p>

<p>Moving on to other applications, now. I want to start tracking nginx. Nginx is just one of the apps Loggly can track. The list is massive.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.06.39.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Getting Nginx set up was just as easy as Linux, although Loggly believed my Nginx logs weren’t of a proper format. No matter, they’re coming in great.</p>

<p>Getting MySQL set up isn’t a one-click process like the others. This requires MySQL to do some extra work and get a bit re-configured. No worries, it’s nothing extravagant.</p>

<p>Setting up PHP was a breeze, and I like a good breeze.</p>

<p>Once everything was added like I wanted, I started poking through my logs to see if I could really find good data without hassle. Turns out, I can.</p>

<p>What’s better than watching someone from China try to hack into your system via SSH by trying to log in as the root user?</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot2015-03-1420.25.24.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Nothing <img src="https://johnathanlyman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>I’d recommend Loggly to anyone who wants to consolidate and be able to parse and search through their log data. You might not need the heavy plans, I know I don’t. It’s still good to be able to look at events as they happen in real time with an interface that doesn’t suck and from anywhere in the world without having to log into your system.</p>

<p>Go check out <a href="http://loggly.com">Loggly</a>, right now. You’ll enjoy it, for sure!</p>

    <p>I use <a href="https://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>. It keeps track of all sorts of goodies for me. The thing I like the most and really appreciate is the visitor tracking. I like knowing how many people visit my site on a regular basis. I don’t use much outside those base features, though. Good thing there’s an app for that.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/logo_black.png?resize=301%2C89" alt="" />There’s a sick little iPhone and OS X app called <a href="http://gagetapp.com">GAget</a>. It’s sole purpose is to provide you with just-the-meat of your <a href="https://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> data including visitor sessions, bounce rate, new visitor percentage, and visit length. On iOS, this comes in the form of a super clean app that you can scroll though. On OS X, it’s a notification center widget. Both are super sexy.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend you check it out on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget-simple-widget-for-google/id968487158?mt=12">OS X App Store</a> ($2.99) or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget/id716442061">iOS App Store</a> ($1.99).</p>

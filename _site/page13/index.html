    <p><a href="http://www.parapublishing.com/sites/para/about/danpoynter.cfm">Dan Poynter</a> once said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you wait for inspiration to write; you’re not a writer, you’re a waiter.I, for one, would hate to work in food service. My wife did that for a while and she hated it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finding inspiration is hard, which is why I don’t like looking for it. To say it takes a lot of effort to figure out what to write about is to say it takes a lot of time to figure out that you want to wear something that looks good on your body, today.</p>

    <p>I’m always looking for new places to discover great services and products. Last night Crozdesk followed me on Twitter and I couldn’t help but check them out and see what they offer. Really, I check out just about anyone that follows me on twitter. I’m by no means a superstar on the social network so I have time for things like that.</p>

<p>Crozdesk is a place to find a company, service, or product offering to fulfill a need you might have in various spaces, be it web design, hosting, social media, marketing, or anything relatively similar.</p>

<p>Their offering list is small-ish but I see it growing quickly as there’s no charge for submitting your product or service to the site. If you’re an indie developer or a small startup that has something cool, this would be the place to share it and let the community rate and offer their opinion on it.</p>

    <p>I’ve been meaning to tinker with Discourse for a while, now. It’s used at several of my favorite sites for their communities so I found it reasonable to try it out for myself and see how it works out.</p>

<p>My end goal was to use it as a comment replacement.</p>

<p>Did I get there?</p>

<p>I think so…</p>

    <p>So I’m sitting here, pondering what to write about. I’ve been a terrible person, not sticking to the plan.</p>

<p>If you know me at all, you’ll know it is indeed a chaotic scene when there’s no plan and I’m involved.</p>

<p>Steven Pressfield is one of my new favorite authors and his book <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a> speaks great truths about what it takes to transition from average joe doing some crap somewhere to becoming a professional and doing what you really want to do.</p>

<p>There’s a small passage in <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a> that fits well in today’s post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twelve-step programs say: “One day at a time.” The professional says the same thing.He’s right though. I could sit here and ramble about how I can’t figure out anything to write, how my creativity is available for just a moment, and how planning out a crazy level of future posts would be fruitless and a waste of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I said all that, it would be true. Sitting here thinking about planning out content makes me tired and want to just watch HBO (which I plan on doing after I finish writing this, anyway). Planning isn’t going to bring creativity. Inspiration is just a trigger for creativity. I could sit and stare out my window at the street and get inspiration creative.</p>

<p>There’s a million ways to come up with an idea, but the best one is the one where you take it one step at a time, one day at a time.</p>

        Keeping Score
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-06-16T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">16 Jun 2015</time>

    <p>I decided to start a project for the wrong reason. It’s because of this reason that I ended up giving up said project for the short term.</p>

<p>I thought I had it all figured out. I carved out time on my calendar, I made plans, I had an idea…</p>

<p>Turns out, the measurement for success in this project was grossly incorrect, and I realized it a couple days ago when I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936891034/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936891034&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=johnatlymanco-20&amp;linkId=SQZD7GW7YIX5GIY5">Steven Pressfield’s Turning Pro</a>. I never finished the book, so I felt it was appropriate to continue.</p>

<p>I came across this passage and it really hit home surrounding this project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real utility of money is its convenience as a medium of exchange. If you and I have a goat in Smyrna, we don’t have to carry the poor beast in our arms all the way to Aleppo to trade it for a carpet. We can sell the goat in Smyrna, stash a silver dairy in our pocket, then take the dairy to Aleppo to buy the carpet.But when we’re addicted to money, we become hooked on the metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is money how we keep score? Is it magic? Is wealth a currency that opens doors, realizes possibilities, produces transcendence?</p>

<p>– Turning Pro</p>

<p>In my case… it was.</p>

<p>I thought I could craft this project and end up getting rich quick. I’ve seen enough documentaries on how that’s never the case but yet I thought otherwise. When my project started, I got a huge influx of traffic to it and I thought it was going to be smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Then the traffic died off, and everyone left. Not a sole gave a damn. I was hoping they’d throw their digital selves at me in the form of coming back or contributing, but they didn’t.</p>

<p>I wanted to make money off this project. I wanted it to become a full-time thing. I didn’t think about the other battle I was waging that would ultimately affect this one.</p>

<p>Losing sight of what’s most important in any project is common and while sometimes it’s recoverable, other times, there’s no way to go but to the bitter end.</p>

<p>I canceled my subscriptions to all the things necessary to keep it running. It’ll die in a few days, and that’s OK by me. It shouldn’t have ever lived. I wasn’t ready for it and I made a Frankenstein.</p>

<p>Such is life.</p>

<p>Learning experiences can be tough sometimes, but when you’re keeping score for all the wrong reasons, it’s bound to happen… and it should. It keeps reality in play.</p>

<p>So instead, I’m focusing on what’s most important and fulfilling for me. I need to keep my head in as few places as possible, while still getting enough stimulation to keep myself fresh and mentally alive.</p>

<p>Too many outlets can lead to burn out, even if all said outlets are appealing. Sometimes, going back to the basics is exactly what the doctor ordered.</p>

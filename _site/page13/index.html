    <p>I did something I never thought I’d have to do. </p>

<p>I traded in my iPhone 5 and signed up for Verizon EDGE and got an iPhone 6.</p>

<p>That means: I’m making payments on my phone.</p>

<p>It might not sound bad to some, and I totally get the idea behind it. It serves a purpose, and I think I discovered one of those purposes. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Up until yesterday, I had a white iPhone 5. It served its purpose. It didn’t have the largest capacity nor was it perfect on the outside. It worked and it worked well… most of the time. On occasion, it would play battery tricks on me that I didn’t appreciate.</p>

<p>For example: I’m using my phone and going about my business when I look at my battery level to see it’s at 50%. No big deal, that’ll last me a few hours at my current pace. A couple minutes later, I look at my screen and am informed I am at 10%. That’s odd, I was at 50% just a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, I’m <em>actually</em> at 4%. Depending on the scenario, my butt might be puckering a bit at this point. As I find a charger and plug it in, my phone tells me I have 50% remaining once more. Unplugging my phone in confusion, my battery stays at 50%. </p>

<p>What did I just experience? Am I in the twilight zone or is the phone hardware just not doing its job reporting remaining charge anymore?</p>

<p>It’s likely the second. In cases where my charge drops dramatically, it will stay there until the likely real charge passes that level, in which case it resumes recording depletion. I had it run on 7% for two hours. </p>

<p>Fun, eh?</p>

<p>I couldn’t handle that drama, anymore. I called Verizon and asked them what it would take to buy out the rest of my contract so I could re-sign and get a new phone. Turns out, it would take a cancellation of my line. Well… that blows.</p>

<p>Oh but wait! Haley, the customer service person on the other end says I’m eligible for a “promotion” that involves signing up for Verizon EDGE so long as I turn in my old phone. Hmm. I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about making monthly payments on a phone, paying full price for it in the end, and still being in a contract, but I didn’t care at the time, and $31 a month isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things. </p>

<p>So in a nutshell, I caved and signed up for what I never thought I would do. On the plus side, I have a sexy new phone that really does kick a lot of ass. On the neutral side, my next bill will be  $140 larger than normal (they bill you for sales tax).</p>

<p>Weeeee!</p>

<p>P.S.: The cat photo has nothing to do with anything I just wrote. I like cats.</p>

    <p>It’s official. We’re headed to California. What that means for my blog is that there might not be a lot of content for the next few weeks. I’m going to try and schedule posts as best I can. I would have something written today but I believe I pulled something in my back last night moving our couch so today was slow going.</p>

<p>Stay safe!</p>

    <p>It’s no secret that I commute a rather long ways (measured by time, not distance) to work every morning. By way of bus it’s 80 minutes. By way of car, it’s 45. The distance is only 20 miles. To some, that’s a lot. I know people that have never commuted more than 20 minutes in any one direction in their life. I envy them. </p>

<p>I envy them because long commutes steal life from creativity, drain the energy from what makes us get up in the morning and want to do what we do, give us motivation to continue long term, and make us wish ever more that the weekend would just hurry up and get here.</p>

<p>One thing that’s likely changing after our move to the Bay Area in a couple months is commuting. We only have one car, and that works for us. After we land, we plan on keeping it that way. Fortunately, we’ve found an area that will allow us to keep the cheap public transit option in play and the need for a second car at bay.</p>

<p>Except this time it’ll be the other way around.</p>

<p>I’ve taken the bus to work for the last three years. Before that, I used to drive into work. I had to be at work at 5AM, so there weren’t many busses that ran from where I was coming from that early. After a shift in location, the bus became an option and we rolled with it. </p>

<p>As each year passed, taking the bus to and from work became gradually easier. </p>

<p>And again this year, it will become easier, still. </p>

<p>There’s a point to all this that I’m trying to make. </p>

<p>I can’t name one person who wouldn’t want a shorter commute. We strive for those extra minutes of sleep. We strive for those extra minutes of being home with our families before sleep. See how odd that is? In the morning, we want nothing more than to sleep in. In the evening, we want nothing more than to be awake to do stuff or e with our families and friends. </p>

<p>Why is there so much prejudice toward the morning?</p>

<p>Everybody’s a morning person, whether they want to admit it or not. I used to believe I wasn’t a morning person, then I started waking up between 4-4:30 am not to go to work, but to write. I started doing something I found interesting and stimulating, and now I do it every week day. The weekends aren’t quite the same, but I’m still up before most people my age.</p>

<p>I used to laugh at the idea of being a morning person. Around that same time, I used to get up at noon, too. I always had an inkling in the back of my mind that I really wanted to be up before the sun and be productive before the Today Show started on the east coast, but I didn’t really understood what that took.</p>

<p>Now, I think I do. I’m not a master of that, yet, as there are still days—like this one—where I falter a bit. With those trick days, it’s important to still try and stick to the routine as much as possible.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of days, I’ve been a bit behind in the mornings and end up doing my writing on the first of two legs of my morning bus journey. Since I usually have ideas already ready to go, putting the words down isn’t very difficult and can be done with little effort. The problem I’m facing now is that I’m getting used to that idea, and that’s not what I want, at all. </p>

<p>When I started this blog in January, the goal was first to just write a few days a week, then it was to create something every day. Both iterations of that goal involved a routine. I talked briefly about hacking my sleep routine—or whatever the startup kids say these days—to make it more qualitatively productive instead of quantitative. That’s been the hardest part throughout all this. As much as I try, I can’t always get to bed at the same time. </p>

<p>Unless I force myself. As I discussed in an <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/magic">earlier post</a> today, one of the things that makes us pro is not rolling with the punches (that’s avoidance), but rather instilling discipline in ourselves. Discipline surrounding every aspect of our lives. We cannot be disciplined in only one area of our lives, but all. </p>

<p>To bring this back around to commutes, like I was originally discussing, long commutes suck but they only suck because they’re not being used to their full potential. Sleeping on the bus is not a productive use of your time. If you can’t sleep in, go to bed earlier. If you can’t go to bed earlier, go to bed at a decent time and wake up at a time in which you’re sleeping at your lightest. It might suck if that time is an hour earlier than what you wanted. If that’s the case, deal with it.</p>

<p>Being flexible is part of the gig. Also sticking to your guns. And discipline. If you get up at the last minute because you want those “extra snoozes” (which are useless, by the way), you’re doing yourself a disservice. Find your light sleep time and get up with that. Do your typical morning routine and when you’re done, see how much extra time you have. Put that time to good use. Do what I do and write a blog post. Or don’t, it doesn’t matter. Just do something besides sit around and watch the news. </p>

<p>And the kid excuse doesn’t work. if your kids are a distraction in the morning, wake up before them. They need more sleep than you, so you don’t have much of an excuse, there. </p>

<p>We blame our long commutes for not having enough time to do things, yet we some how seem to be able to make time on one side of them, every single day. If we made time on the other side of them, we wouldn’t be complaining. When I get off this bus, I’m done with this task. I’m moving on to another. I’ve established this time for the purpose of writing and that’s that.</p>

<p>If I can do this, you can, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the pro mindset is a discipline that we use to overcome Resistance . To defeat the self-sabotaging habits of procrastination, self-doubt, susceptibility to distraction, perfectionism, and shallowness, we enlist the self-strengthening habits of order, regularity, discipline, and a constant striving after excellence.Interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s something we tend to do a lot, especially when the waters aren’t smooth sailing. It involves justifying mediocrity, delaying, and otherwise finding excuses. </p>

<p>I’m not talking about excuses for why X isn’t done on time, or why you forgot Y at the grocery store. I’m talking about excuses for ourselves. Excuses for our behaviors. Excuses for our amateur-ness.</p>

<p>The resolution is simple. Rules. Routine. +1-ing the day before. It’s easy to say “I’ll do it tomorrow,” and God knows I’m guilty of that like none other, but fixing that is simple: combat procrastination with scheduling. </p>

<p>I schedule a lot of my tasks at work and firmly believe that extending that scheduling to my personal life can make a big difference. For example: I’ve been meaning to clean up my car a bit. It’s getting dirty on the inside. Unfortunately, I don’t drive it much during the week so it’s been put by the wayside. If I were to block out an hour of time this weekend to take care of that, I’d be more likely to do just that.</p>

<p>We can combat perfectionism by understanding the concept of striving for excellence. Let me tell you something. If you ever plan on finishing that one thing you’ve been working on for months but feel it has to be just right, you’re never going to get it done. </p>

<p>The only way you’ll be able to get that thing out there and improve for the next is to let it go. Don’t throw it away, but let go of the idea that if you just tweak that one thing in that one place, it’ll be magically perfect. Pro tip: that’s a whack expectation.</p>

<p>Magic isn’t real. It’s illusionary in nature. Magic shows trick your mind into seeing and believing what’s not real. At the same time, we also trick ourselves into believing what we want by way of all of the above. We become distracted by the fluff and the illusionary perfectionism that we forget what’s actually going on behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Unless you plan on being a magician, ditch the magic.</p>

    <p>One thing I’ve always found so amazing is that with today’s excellent blend of technologies to keep people living longer, we regularly see people living past 100 years of age.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you live to be 109 years old? Exercise, a nice warm bowl of porridge, and staying away from men—at least that’s the explanation given by Scotland’s oldest woman, Jessie Gallan, in a story that  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2912299/Scotland-s-oldest-woman-Jessie-Gallan-reveals-longevity-secrets-including-eating-porridge-avoiding-men.html">went viral earlier this year</a>.[<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/15/how-the-world-s-oldest-people-live-so-long.html">s</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It’s quite wild to think that there’s a possibility I might live to be that long. Shortly after that realization another one hits: I’m going to need to save more for retirement. Most retirement plans account for 20-30 years between retirement and death. If I want to stick to my valiant plans of retiring at 55, I’m going to need more than that. If I’m Jessie, I’ll need 50 years. Oh boy. Good thing there are services to help manage money out there. I’m not sure I could do that on my own.</p>

<p>I’m not even going to start on the age of the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2572316/The-secret-long-life-Sushi-sleep-according-worlds-oldest-woman.html">oldest living woman</a> at 118 years. I just can’t. It’s daunting to think that there’s so much more life left to live after retirement for some people. Usually when you reach that point, things change and daily life changes. I don’t think I could deal with that for over 60 years.</p>

<p>Then again, I could just retire later, too.</p>

<p>That’s so long from now, God only knows what’ll happen.</p>

    <p>Comcast, I hope you’re reading this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SageTV founder (and current Google employee) Jeffrey Kardatzke says that Google “has agreed to open-source the SageTV platform.”[<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/16/google-open-sourcing-sage-tv/?ncid=rss_truncated">s</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar, SageTV has been off the market for a few years now after being one of the first to release a DVR box and home theater PC software title. Google bought it up and pulled it away, only to end up using it in their Google Fiber TV box.</p>

<p>It’s great to see this kind of move. There’s a lot of capability in set top boxes that go untouched. I can speak from experience with my X1 box from Comcast. I have HDMI in and out, of which I can only use the OUT. I also have USB and Ethernet, both of which do nothing. I would love to be able to use the ethernet jack instead. It would behoove Comcast to switch to an IPTV-type setup, instead. The bandwidth of traditional cable (QAM256) is limited to something like 39mbps per channel, and each channel is typically split in half (since there aren’t enough channels in the spectrum for 1:1 usage). That brings us down to 19.8mbps per channel, at max. That’s not bad, but it could be better. Blu-Ray discs are usually 25-35mbps for video and roughly 5-8mbps for audio. Compressed 5.1 is roughly 1.5mbps so taking that out of our 19.8mbps stream leaves us with 18.3mbps.</p>

<p>But enough about that. I can ramble about the quality of a TV signal all day. The point is that each stream could be any number of bits in size, not just a technological maximum of 19.8mbps. The trick would be switching streams in a timely manner and implementing some pretty hardcore QoS all along the pipe to ensure the TV signal doesn’t become degraded because your kids are having a LAN party in their room and sucking up all the Internets.</p>

<p>Even without a move to IPTV, opening up a box to other apps and developers would make for a much more desirable platform, regardless of the vendor. One thing I’ve always wanted on my X1 was a Netflix app. Will that happen? Probably not, so long as Comcast has a beef with Netflix.</p>

<p>The trick will be to not let too many crazy things through the flood gates. If app developers start making shoddy apps, the quality of service for the entire system becomes compromised, and we know how Google loves to keep Android and open platform and what that ultimately does for the quality of apps.</p>

<p>Last week, I spent 30 minutes <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/half-hour" title="Half Hour of Random">writing non-stop</a>. I didn’t think about what I was writing, nor did I stop to even see if what I wrote flowed. At the end, I just published it. The premise behind that exercise was to not just pad my monthly word count, but to simply see what ideas come to mind as I write.</p>

<p>The result was quite interesting. There were clear transitions between topics, but each of those topics was a morph from the one previous. It’s as though when I was discussing one thing, another idea started forming in my mind.</p>

<p>Another prime example is just today when I was discussing <a href="http://johnathanlyman.com/p/sage" title="Open-Source SageTV">SageTV</a>. I started going on about QAM 256 and channel bandwidth and other non-related stuff all to come back to the point of there being better ways to go about executing a set top box in 2015 like what Google’s doing.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(writer)" title="John Rogers">Rogers</a> is talking about. I could easily have another couple posts right there about things I have at least some knowledge of. I could explain the intricacies of QAM and bore the hell out of you. I could also explain why open-sourcing a set-top box is both a great and a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Perhaps I will. Who knows. The point is that I wouldn’t have even thought of those topics to talk about had I not written about them.</p>

<p>This is one of the many reasons why I like writing on a regular basis. There isn’t some massive end-goal in mind. I’m not trying to build a mega-blog full of money-making ideas that I can litter with ads and end up in a penthouse. Not even close. I write because it stimulates my mind and gives me new things to talk about and new ideas to ponder. There isn’t another medium of creativity where I’ve been able to work out how to write at a pace of almost 3500 words an hour.</p>

<p>Some say I should really write a book.</p>

    <p>Voyager 1 and 2. Covering a million miles a day, these two crafts are still humming along. After 40 years of travel, they still gather data, and some of the original crew still watch over them… even if they do so from a simple office park in Pasadena.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/15/voyager-1-and-2-space-journey-nasa">Reading about Steve Howard</a>, 65, the man who’s in a group of people controlling the space crafts from 16 light hours away, is quite humbling. Voyager 1 took a “family photo” of the solar system 25 years ago and in 2036, will shut down. Most sensors will do so long before the nine 2025 as its Plutonium-238 reactor dwindles into nothingness, but an eleven more years is still an impressive feat. </p>

<p>Howard will be 90 by then. There isn’t much of a change either Voyager will find anything super interesting until 40,000 years from now, when they’ll be dead metal and nothing more.</p>

<p>The next time you complain your internet is slow, think about Steve and his 17 34 hour round-trip transmission time from his computer, through the Deep Space Network, to Voyager 1. </p>

    <p>I’ve been mulling this idea over in my head for a few weeks, now and now I think it’s time to start it. I’m starting a series of posts on various managed WordPress offerings and my impressions of them. Since I run a WordPress site by hand, I believe it’ll allow me to have a fair point of view when it comes to transitioning to a managed service.</p>

<p>What I’ll be looking for is a roughly the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signup Process. How easy was it to sign up for the service?</li>
  <li>Migration. How much time would it take to migrate a site and if it costs more, how much extra?</li>
  <li>Launching. How easy it is to go live from the time the account becomes active?</li>
  <li>Extra Features. Are things like SSL and CDNs included? Are they limited to certain plans? </li>
  <li>Price Point. How much would it cost to get into the service?</li>
  <li>Free Trials. This is a big one for a lot of people. Does the service have a free trial that can be exercised? 
Here’s a list of the services I plan on going over in the next month or so:</li>
</ul>

<p>Flywheel<br />
Kinsta<br />
Pagely<br />
MediaTemple<br />
DreamHost<br />
Pantheon<br />
WPEngine<br />
WordPress.com<br />
Synthesis<br />
Pressable</p>

<p>If you have any other services you’d like to see covered, please let me know in the comments below.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

    <p>I’m a fan of getting as much as you can for free without breaking the rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every cloud storage provider has a variety of changing promos that can give you extra storage space, so it’s always worthwhile to keep an ear to the ground. Some of the promotions we mention here may change over time, but they’ll also likely be replaced by something else. Cloud storage providers seem to like giving away space like candy if it means new customers.Check out the <a href="http://drippler.com/drip/how-maximize-your-free-storage-space-every-cloud-service">full article, here</a>! I can speak to the Dropbox bonuses, personally. I have 10GB and didn’t spend a dime to get it.</p>

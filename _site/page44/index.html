        Vivaldi &#8211; A New Browser for our Friends
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-27T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">27 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>So there’s a new browser in town, put out by ex Opera big cheese Jón Stephenson von Tetzchner. It’s called <a href="https://vivaldi.net">Vivaldi</a> and so far, it looks just as good as Vivaldi’s music sounds.</p>

<p>Vivaldi came to be after coming to the conclusion that Opera (the browser) just ain’t what it used to be. According to the <a href="https://vivaldi.net">site</a>: “[Opera] is no longer serving its community of users and contributors who helped build the browser in the first place.” That’s a bummer. I liked Opera for a while, but then it started feeling super fat. It started feeling like Firefox. For what it’s worth, at the time, all third party browsers were feeling super bloated like they needed to have extra water drained out of them.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot2015-01-2718.00.17.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>I downloaded it just now and toyed around with it for a bit. Obviously, on a Mac, installing an app is simple to the point of condescension in most cases. Just drag and drop it into the Applications folder.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot2015-01-2718.01.58.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>On launch, there’s not much going on. Once you start browsing sites, it’ll do what other browsers do and show you your most visited sites. The UI is flat and clean. It blends super well with the UI theme that OS X Yosemite carries, and doesn’t feel out of place. The tab idea must really be working with users because it seems quite similar to just about every other name brand browser out there, which is fine. There’s no sense in reinventing the wheel if your existing wheel is super fast.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1_Screenshot2015-01-2718.02.20.png?resize=882%2C551" alt="" /></p>

<p>After launching a few sites, I noticed a really cool trend. The site icon that appears in the tab dictates the UI’s main color. The Vivaldi has a mostly red icon ergo the UI is the same shade red. Visiting The Great Discontent changes the UI to black, and Google to blue. It’s a subtle touch but is much appreciated. It takes the branding of the site the user is viewing and extends it over their whole screen. It’s almost as if the brand bleeds into the whole browsing experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2_1_Screenshot2015-01-2718.02.38.png?resize=882%2C551" alt="" />There are a load of cool features coming soon, according to the Vivaldi Web site including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mail.</strong> What’s better than a really good competitor to Gmail? Who says they have to eat all the cake?</li>
  <li><strong>Bookmark/Notes/History/Session syncing across different devices.</strong> Smells like a hint that mobile will be a real thing.</li>
  <li><strong>Keyboard-based (Spatial) Navigation.</strong> Sounds like it could be good. Will have to wait and see how this turns out.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Boosts.</strong> Nothing like a snappy quick browser. Even being slightly cracked out is OK, so long as it’s stable.</li>
  <li><strong>Extensions.</strong> Your browser needs to do so much more these days and they want to make sure that happens in the most secure method possible without impacting performance.</li>
  <li><strong>And More…</strong> They’re taking suggestions from the <a href="https://vivaldi.net/forum">community</a>!
Download: <a href="https://vivaldi.net">Vivaldi.net</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m looking forward to seeing what this baby can do, especially with the upcoming release from Microsoft of their new “Spartan” browser!</p>

        Favorite Thing to This Day
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-27T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">27 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>In school my favorite subject was “Computers.” At the time, I didn’t quite know what that meant, nor did I really care. Kids thought I was nerdy because computers weren’t cool. The popular kids didn’t care about computers, they were athletes. That’s how they made friends. That didn’t deter me from keeping up with what I enjoyed the most.</p>

<p>I started with HTML in the 6th grade, and it escalated from there to include design and photography. Today, I work in IT at a rather large software company you might have heard of, and I enjoy it. If I had to change career paths at this very moment, the only shift I would make would be to photography, something that was stimulated by computers, too.</p>

<p>I experienced my first Mac around the 6th grade timeframe, too, but it was one of those colorful eMacs with the round one-button mice. I remember the next year my school bought newer white iMacs, still of the tube-television style one-piece setups, but the mice weren’t completely round anymore—though they still had one button.</p>

<p>Jump forward a couple years later into high school, and that’s when I got to feel my first, what I felt like was a legit iMac. It was a behemoth at 27” in screen size and I was blown away by it. The resolution—all those pixels—and the ability to have so much on screen and be able to do it all at once!</p>

<p>That was my last real contact with a mac until I bought my own in 2011. Don’t get me wrong, I used Windows computers, too. I built my own gaming-purposed desktop in the beginning of 2011 and rocked it like no other. However, it didn’t stick with me like my 15” Macbook Pro did. That same Macbook Pro is sitting in front of me right now. It’ll be four years old in roughly eight months and while I sank a lot of money into that gaming desktop I built, I can’t say it would be running the same this many years later, without intervention.</p>

<p>In IT, I’ve supported Macs, PCs, Windows servers, Linux servers, and any blend of those four technologies. If It hadn’t been for my interest in computers from the very beginning (with a Packard bell 486DX2-66), I don’t think any of my interests I have today would have flourished in any way.</p>

        Just Sit Down and Write with Desk
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-27T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">27 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>I’ve been writing pretty religiously for the last few weeks now—I officially started this new chapter on January 6th—and one thing I’ve failed to talk much about is what exactly I do my writing on. I could go into a huge, winded preamble about how the best software matters and this and that and the other thing, but I’ll spare you the sappy crap. The reality is, I have one app I use when I’m at my desk, tapping away at my keyboard, making words appear in sentence form on a screen. It’s called <a href="http://desk.pm">Desk</a>. Yes, I use my computer on my desk, but on my computer is Desk. Boy that would be confusing if English wasn’t your first language. Anyway, without sounding two advertorial—sorry not sorry—I want to tell you a bit about the app.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1-Desk-App-Screenshot-Platforms.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Desk is a minimalist writing app. To say it’s minimalist might not actually be the right word for it. It’s more of a digital, software-based representation of a spiral notebook. See, Desk serves one purpose: be that guy you always go to when you need to talk about some stuff write. It allows you to be as distraction-free as possible and maintain a sense of organization and being “with it.” </p>

<p>Desk supports most of the popular platforms as of version 1.1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WordPress</li>
  <li>Blogger</li>
  <li>Tumblr</li>
  <li>Facebook Notes</li>
  <li>Typepad</li>
  <li>Squarespace</li>
  <li>MovableType
Platforms such as Ghost are hopefully coming soon!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2-Desk-App-Screenshot-Speed.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Publishing a post to any of your blogging platforms of choice takes but a few seconds, and with the option of enabling Quick Publish, it becomes a one-click setup. If you write the same type of content every day, this becomes a no brainer. </p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3-Desk-App-Screenshot-iCloud-Local.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>All articles you write can be saved to your iCloud Drive, along with anywhere else on your Mac. This is great if you start work on one Mac and finish on another (say at home and work). Your work travels with you from computer to computer. </p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-Desk-App-Screenshot-Markdown-WYSIWYG.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Desk on screen editor works in two ways: Markdown (awesome) or HTML (awesome, too.) With HTML mode off, the final formatting can be displayed in a separate preview window. If you’re good with Markdown, you’ll really enjoy writing with Desk. </p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/5-Desk-App-Screenshot-Edit-Existing-Posts.png?w=882" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let’s not forget one important feature. Desk might be just a text-centric writing application, but that doesn’t stop it from being able to edit existing posts published to your platforms. From the side menu—where you do almost everything—you can select an existing post to work on or update without ever having to launch your browser or log into an admin page on your site.</p>

<p>This might not have been a super in-depth look at the tool and to be honest, a deep dive wouldn’t have been necessary. Yeah, it has all the basic stuff most text editors have, but on the flip side, it’s that way on purpose. It’s not trying to be an end-all writing app for everyone. It’s not meant for screenwriters (although I’m sure you could use it for that, if you wanted… no one’s stopping you) or authors of books. Desk is meant for the Web and blogging. If you’re someone, like me, who likes to write every day and push their thoughts to a blog, this is your deal. At $30 on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk-writing-blogging-notetaking/id915839505?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>, it’s worth every penny.</p>

        Taking Notes
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>Reflecting on my journey so far, one thing I’ve noticed that seems to be most consistent is my desire to write has improved, ten fold. Instead of coming up with huge elaborate stories or long-winded essays about something I don’t even know if I completely understand, I’m starting to keep my thoughts to under a thousand words. This keeps me from getting bored with what I write, and if I do choose to write something more long-form, I can do so without feeling like that’s all I do and it’s just more words on a page. I’m also finding that I’m wanting to take time out of my day, whenever it is, to “write something real quick.” Take last weekend, for example, I wrote a total of [x] posts and published them all. Were they all related? No, but they were all things I had going on in my head and I made sure to take the time to put them down and share them. </p>

<p>Going forward, I think this is something I’ll be doing more often. This has been a product of the changes in my morning routine now that I’m writing every day, almost without fail. So far I’ve had to resort to looking at my notes but a few times, but I can only speculate if that’ll get better or worse. I have at any one time, several different things I’m pondering or thinking about and am taking note of them on my iPhone with the built-in Notes app so when I get home in the evening or start spinning up first thing in the morning, I can look back on it and pick up where I left off. There’s no shame in checking notes to remember what you might want to talk about. I have complete faith that even the best of us do that, too. </p>

<p>If you have a lot of things you want to talk about but don’t ever remember them, writing them down when they pop into your head could save your bacon one day!</p>

        Positioning for the Journey to Dreamland

    <time datetime="2015-01-26T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>I saw a rather interesting article this morning <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324595704578241642030220064">via the Wall Street Journal</a> that talks about finding the perfect sleep position. I couldn’t help but think: “is there some mad science in here that will give me the answer to all things sleeping so I can sleep mad sleeps and wake up feeling like a million dollars?” Well, no. The only way to wake up feeling like a stack of cash is either a) have a million dollars or b) eat some of those crazy mushrooms the kids like.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324595704578241642030220064">This article</a> had some good points that I wanted to recap because it’s something I struggle with from time to time, and after adjusting my morning routine to better serve my daily writing goals, the best sleep I can get from the limited time I have is fine by me.</p>

<p>Looking back on even last night’s sleep, I started out on my side, and the article puts me in the majority with 57% of sleepers starting out that way. Sometimes, if I’m already pretty relaxed, I’ll start on my back, and let my eyes literally roll back into my head (weird I know). That’s something only 17% of people seem to do, and for those stomach sleepers out there, you’re the odder of the bunch at 11% for starting positions.</p>

<figure id="attachment_293" style="width: 629px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-293 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/johnathanlyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2680866397_f6107a9fe0_o-1024x842.jpg?resize=629%2C517" alt="2680866397_f6107a9fe0_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This doesn’t seem to be a good position to sleep in, but that’s just me. Ed Yourdon; flickr.</figcaption></figure>
<p> </p>

<p>What I really found interesting is just in the next paragraph, the author talks about the variance in the amount of times people toss and turn during the night: as few as three times to as many as 36. I would have no way of knowing where I fall in that category unless I videotaped myself. I’m ok not knowing that much about my sleeping habits.</p>

<p>I whole-heartedly believe it’s important to make sure I am sleeping “properly” or as close to it as I can. I try to avoid pain areas in the sense that I’ll sleep on the opposite side if I’m favoring an area or if my back hurts, I’ll try to lay as flat as I can, to keep as much tension and pressure off it as possible.</p>

<p>If you have time—if you don’t, I think you should make time— <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324595704578241642030220064">go read the article form the Wall Street Journal</a>. Sleep is important and making sure you’re getting the most out of it is crucial to morning success. Not all of us can just spring out of bed before the birds.</p>

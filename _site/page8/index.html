    <p><a href="http://www.parapublishing.com/sites/para/about/danpoynter.cfm">Dan Poynter</a> once said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you wait for inspiration to write; you’re not a writer, you’re a waiter.I, for one, would hate to work in food service. My wife did that for a while and she hated it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finding inspiration is hard, which is why I don’t like looking for it. To say it takes a lot of effort to figure out what to write about is to say it takes a lot of time to figure out that you want to wear something that looks good on your body, today.</p>

    <p>I’m always looking for new places to discover great services and products. Last night Crozdesk followed me on Twitter and I couldn’t help but check them out and see what they offer. Really, I check out just about anyone that follows me on twitter. I’m by no means a superstar on the social network so I have time for things like that.</p>

<p>Crozdesk is a place to find a company, service, or product offering to fulfill a need you might have in various spaces, be it web design, hosting, social media, marketing, or anything relatively similar.</p>

<p>Their offering list is small-ish but I see it growing quickly as there’s no charge for submitting your product or service to the site. If you’re an indie developer or a small startup that has something cool, this would be the place to share it and let the community rate and offer their opinion on it.</p>

    <p>I’ve been meaning to tinker with Discourse for a while, now. It’s used at several of my favorite sites for their communities so I found it reasonable to try it out for myself and see how it works out.</p>

<p>My end goal was to use it as a comment replacement.</p>

<p>Did I get there?</p>

<p>I think so…</p>

    <p>So I’m sitting here, pondering what to write about. I’ve been a terrible person, not sticking to the plan.</p>

<p>If you know me at all, you’ll know it is indeed a chaotic scene when there’s no plan and I’m involved.</p>

<p>Steven Pressfield is one of my new favorite authors and his book <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a> speaks great truths about what it takes to transition from average joe doing some crap somewhere to becoming a professional and doing what you really want to do.</p>

<p>There’s a small passage in <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a> that fits well in today’s post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twelve-step programs say: “One day at a time.” The professional says the same thing.He’s right though. I could sit here and ramble about how I can’t figure out anything to write, how my creativity is available for just a moment, and how planning out a crazy level of future posts would be fruitless and a waste of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I said all that, it would be true. Sitting here thinking about planning out content makes me tired and want to just watch HBO (which I plan on doing after I finish writing this, anyway). Planning isn’t going to bring creativity. Inspiration is just a trigger for creativity. I could sit and stare out my window at the street and get inspiration creative.</p>

<p>There’s a million ways to come up with an idea, but the best one is the one where you take it one step at a time, one day at a time.</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page8/" rel="bookmark" title="Keeping Score">Keeping Score</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-06-16T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">June 16, 2015  | 121 words</time>
    <p>I decided to start a project for the wrong reason. It’s because of this reason that I ended up giving up said project for the short term.</p>

<p>I thought I had it all figured out. I carved out time on my calendar, I made plans, I had an idea…</p>

<p>Turns out, the measurement for success in this project was grossly incorrect, and I realized it a couple days ago when I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936891034/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936891034&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=johnatlymanco-20&amp;linkId=SQZD7GW7YIX5GIY5">Steven Pressfield’s Turning Pro</a>. I never finished the book, so I felt it was appropriate to continue.</p>

<p>I came across this passage and it really hit home surrounding this project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real utility of money is its convenience as a medium of exchange. If you and I have a goat in Smyrna, we don’t have to carry the poor beast in our arms all the way to Aleppo to trade it for a carpet. We can sell the goat in Smyrna, stash a silver dairy in our pocket, then take the dairy to Aleppo to buy the carpet.But when we’re addicted to money, we become hooked on the metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is money how we keep score? Is it magic? Is wealth a currency that opens doors, realizes possibilities, produces transcendence?</p>

<p>– Turning Pro</p>

<p>In my case… it was.</p>

<p>I thought I could craft this project and end up getting rich quick. I’ve seen enough documentaries on how that’s never the case but yet I thought otherwise. When my project started, I got a huge influx of traffic to it and I thought it was going to be smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Then the traffic died off, and everyone left. Not a sole gave a damn. I was hoping they’d throw their digital selves at me in the form of coming back or contributing, but they didn’t.</p>

<p>I wanted to make money off this project. I wanted it to become a full-time thing. I didn’t think about the other battle I was waging that would ultimately affect this one.</p>

<p>Losing sight of what’s most important in any project is common and while sometimes it’s recoverable, other times, there’s no way to go but to the bitter end.</p>

<p>I canceled my subscriptions to all the things necessary to keep it running. It’ll die in a few days, and that’s OK by me. It shouldn’t have ever lived. I wasn’t ready for it and I made a Frankenstein.</p>

<p>Such is life.</p>

<p>Learning experiences can be tough sometimes, but when you’re keeping score for all the wrong reasons, it’s bound to happen… and it should. It keeps reality in play.</p>

<p>So instead, I’m focusing on what’s most important and fulfilling for me. I need to keep my head in as few places as possible, while still getting enough stimulation to keep myself fresh and mentally alive.</p>

<p>Too many outlets can lead to burn out, even if all said outlets are appealing. Sometimes, going back to the basics is exactly what the doctor ordered.</p>

    <p>What do you think of when I say that amateurs look for excuses?</p>

<p>It’s a rhetorical question and I don’t expect an answer. Instead, that sentence should really be a statement. It’s an obvious one to someone who’s paying attention, but on the inside, it’s harder.</p>

<p>Also known as the easy way out, looking to find a way out of a tough situation by copping out or giving up is modus operandi of those who can’t hack it. Amateurs.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about people who aren’t good enough at a specific thing. No one should expect to be experts at everything they do. What I’m talking about is life. Sticking with the shit that comes your way. Dealing with less than ideal situations.</p>

<p>Whoever first said “shit happens” is the realist realist the world will ever experience. One thing a professional understands is that sometimes you step in it, but the best route is to clean it off and keep moving.</p>

<p>This idea became one I find myself gravitating towards after reading a relevant passage in <a href="http://amzn.to/1G234yc">Turning Pro</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The habits and addictions of the amateur are…self-inflicted wounds…[Amateurs] no longer have to face the real fight of our lives, which is to become who we are and to realize our destiny and our calling.That’s not some hippie shit from a guy smoking weed. That’s real talk from a guy who used to be an amateur. If you’ve ever thought about reading what it takes to rock life and kick it’s ass, he’s the guy to go to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about this: how easy is it to make an excuse? It just slips right on out there without anyone noticing… except you… time and again… uttering the same garbage… because you can’t accept the fact you failed at something… or many somethings.</p>

<p>A pro would admit wrong and rectify it. Today. Right freaking now.</p>

<p>You also don’t see pros telling their boss they didn’t have time to create that presentation that’s due today, even though all they did was sit on Reddit and bitch about their boss. An amateur is quick to make excuses for themselves to protect their mediocrity and constant state of incapacitation of potential.</p>

<p>I made a small resolution to kick ass this year, and this is one of the many ways to do it because 2015 isn’t quite over. I don’t have to relocate my foot in someone’s ass physically, to rock my goal.</p>

<p>One of the many ways it starts is by accepting the challenge that lays in front of me, every day. Each moment, there’s a hurdle, and each moment I can jump or smash into it like a lumbering blob of crap.</p>

<p>The latter doesn’t sound so appealing, does it…</p>

      <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://johnathanlyman.com/page8/" rel="bookmark" title="The Cost of Cutting the Cord">The Cost of Cutting the Cord</a></h1>
    
    <time datetime="2015-06-07T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">June 07, 2015  | 121 words</time>
    <p>People talk about “cutting the cord” a.k.a canceling their Cable or Satellite service and opting for internet-based services. One thing that doesn’t seem to get a whole lot of coverage, in my opinion, is the cost of cutting the cord.</p>

<p>While this might be a bit biased because of circumstances, I wanted to compare what I’m paying every month for Comcast and how much it would cost to cut it out and switch to online services.</p>

<p>So here’s the breakdown. When it comes to single-purchase items, we’ll divide it up over 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Comcast Xfinity Double Play:</strong> $125/month (after taxes/fees)</p>

<p><strong>Subtract Internet Serivce:</strong> x 50%<br />
 <strong>Cable Price:</strong> $62.50So we have $62.50 to work with. Let’s start:</p>

<p><strong>Netflix:</strong> $9</p>

<p><strong>Hulu+:</strong> $9<br />
<strong>SlingTV (plus add ons to match):</strong> $20 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5<br />
 <strong>HBONow</strong>** :** $15<br />
<strong>HD Antenna (for locals):</strong> $40/12 = $3.33 <strong>Total:</strong> $76.33</p>

<p>Adding the cost for subscribing the same speed Internet package as a standalone service will add as much as $40/month on top of the Internet half of the above $125. All in all, we’re looking at $176.33 to match what I already have. That doesn’t seem like much of a good deal.</p>

<p>Let me be clear about a couple things: I aimed high on purpose. Not everyone would need everything and maybe if you only watch a few channels, you’d be able to save some money. However, Internet-only packages are expensive and unless you’re okay with the bare minimum speed from your provider, you’re going to end up paying quite a bit which really doesn’t make it worth it, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I also need to say that I watch a lot of variety of television programming in addition to the simple stuff that’s easy to access via one of the above services.</p>

<p>Perhaps at some point when Internet-only prices come down, this might make sense, but adding an extra $50 to “cut the cord” that I still use for Internet doesn’t make sense.</p>

    <p>Historically, the weekends have been hard on my hobbies.</p>

<p>There’s a photographer that I follow on an occasional basis, mainly because his typical subjects aren’t necessarily family friendly. His name is <a href="http://mattgranger.com">Matt Granger</a>. He has a saying that I’m finding myself stuck to more now than ever: “Get Your Gear Out.”</p>

<p>He’s right. I need to. If I call myself a landscape photographer, why is my camera gear sitting in my bag all the time?</p>

<p>I have a couple locations I want to visit this weekend that are relatively close by (one is just down the street, actually). I’m looking forward to what I can capture this weekend.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-06-05T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">June 05, 2015  | 121 words</time>
    <p>I could make this list a mile long, literally, but hindsight is always 20/20 and there’s a load of things we wish we could do differently. In this case, I’m paring this list down to three things that while I wish I would have done sooner, are not too late to start, now.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-code">Learn to Code</h2>
<p>This is one thing I wish I would have started a lot sooner, and is probably by far the highest on my list, and plays a lot into my other two wishes.</p>

<p>I entered the software development game much later than a lot of my peers who are already developers of various capacities. I didn’t get any formal programming experience until the end of 2013. I had an opportunity to transition into it full time and I should have taken it. Instead, I opted not to because I wasn’t thinking about my future.</p>

<p>I had a great job, that could have been even better had I paid attention. Instead, I lost it due to attrition and without a doubt I believe that had I chose door number one instead, I would have likely stayed on and worked there for some time.</p>

<p>Now, I’m basically starting from the beginning. I know how to write Python and I can understand just about any code I read, but I’m not a programmer. I wouldn’t mind being one, but I have yet to understand the fundamentals, even.</p>

<p>I started a free course from the University of Michigan via Coursera on Python and I hope this gives me some foundation on software development. I’m not ready to learn a massive language, yet. I need to master the basics, first, and Python is a great language (in my opinion) to do just that.</p>

<h2 id="consider-education-important">Consider Education Important</h2>
<p>When I was in high school, I didn’t give two shits about it, and if future me could have gone back and punched at-the-time current me in the face every time I was being stupid, I would have had a black eye on a weekly basis. Because I gave so little thought to my education at the time, I barely made it out in one piece.</p>

<p>I had the ability to go on to a great college and probably not have to pay for it. I could have done something awesome with my time. I figure I’d have a masters degree in something awesome I like and be doing something totally different, probably related to wish #1.</p>

<p>As much as people say college can be a waste of time and money, I firmly believe that if you point your energy in the right direction, and get a meaningful degree in something that can turn into a long-lasting career, then spend away.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m about six years behind the boat. I’m in college, now, but I wasn’t expecting it to take this long. Fortunately, with the advent of online programs, I’m working on a degree in something meaningful that I enjoy and am still able to have a life and a job, as well.</p>

<h2 id="spend-more-time-on-hobbies">Spend More Time on Hobbies</h2>
<p>I wish I had spent more time on hobbies that I found interesting in the last five or so years. I only have a few hobbies I really enjoy, but I only spent enough time on them for them to remain just interesting enough to partake in on an occasional basis. One of these hobbies is photography. I know that if I set my mind to it, I could do great things in that space, but even to this day I still fight with the idea of “I can do it later” and then boom you’re moving out of state and that giant list of places you wanted to photograph in Washington are now out of reach for a while.</p>

<p>So I have a big list of places in Washington State that I never got to photograph. It’s no one’s fault but mine. I’m physically capable of making all the necessary preparations and treks to those spots. I was just too lazy and sitting at home playing video games sounded fun at the time.</p>

<p>Now that everything has settled down here in California, this is something I’m devoting more time to. I really enjoy shooting and getting some time to enjoy nature, so now I have no excuses. I’m starting to plan out my adventures on my schedule and am going to stick to them just like I plan on sticking to everything else on the list.</p>

<p>——————————————-</p>

<p>In the end, though, there are a lot of things I would likely have to give up if my life had played out differently, and knowing what I know now about them, I can’t say I’d be okay with that. For starters, I probably would have never met my wife and she’s my best friend. I can’t say that I’d give her up for more programming experience, a larger photography portfolio or a higher grade point average in high school. Those things are all relative and while they have impacts on the future, their effects can still be corrected.</p>
